Abstract

Time-frequency analysis is intrested in simultaneous representation of signals
in time and frequency. The discrete representation of such signals can be studied in
terms of fraine theory whosc fundamental result is that: any signal f ∈ L²(ℝᵈ) can
be written as a sum, provided that the so-called upper and lower frame bounds
exist from the frame inequalities. An exainple of such a frame in the context
of time-frequency analysis arc the Gabor frames, which can be constructed by
discretely sampling the continuous Short-Time Fourier transform with a single
window function on points in the time-frequency plane with some nice structure,
an example of such arc lattices. Generalizations of Gabor frames have also been
studied. for example, time-frequency systems where multiple window functions
are allowed, or when the sampling points are not necessarily restricted to have
any structure. These gencralizcd frames can also be adapted to certain properties
of signals. An example of such an adaptive system is Dörfler’s quilted Gabor
frames, w hich shows that an upper frame bound exists for a system constructed
by quilting local time-frequency systems from pre-existing Gabor frames. In this
work, we show that we do not need the existence of Gabor frames to construct
an upper frame bound for Dérfier’s construction. Furthermore, we prove that our
relaxed construction admits a lower frame bound by using density techniques on
irregular sampling. This results to an adaptive frame from local time frequency
systems. We also use results from relevant sampling to construct other adaptive time-frequency systems.

Introduction

Given a signal, the classical result of Fourier analysis is that it should be pos-
sible to ‘break up’ the original signal to simpler waves corresponding to cach
of its constituent frequencies, and reconstruct it back by superposition of these
simpler waves. In a more abstract setting, we are given a suitable function f
of time that represents a signal, and we can apply to it the Fourier transform
F, which can be interpreted as an operator that extracts the frequencies present
in the signal. Mathematically speaking, the above is possible since it can be
shown that the Fourier transform is an invertible linear operator acting on suit-
able function spaces. The general basic form of the Fourier transform is given by
the mapping f(x) ++ (Ff)(w) = Jeu f(z)e-***")de and its inverse is given by
fw) + (Ff)(x) = fou f(w)e?***")du. Therefore we have the inversion forinula
given by

(x!

= (FEN) = [A Nlwemede.

The equation above then, is a continuous representation of the signal f in terms of
its continuous frequency spectrum Ff, with x = (x1, %2,...,t4) € R@ interpreted
as the time (temporal) axis, and w = (wy,w2,...,wa) € R¢ interpreted as the
frequency (spectral) axis. While the invertibility of the Fourier transform allows
us, in principle, to peer freely between the temporal and spectral behavior of a
signal, it is by itself. not a sufficient tool for doing so simultaneously. To claborate,

the classical Fourier transform might give us the frequencies of a signal, but it does

not give us any information on when these frequencies occur. In gencral, as it quite
happens in practice, the frequency of a signal may also differ in time. The ficld
of time-frequency analysis emerged from this problem, and it is interested in the
theory and techniques that allows for simultaneous representation of a signal in
both the time and frequency domains. This idea of finding a representation of a
signal simultancously in both domains also has an intrinsic localization problem.
For simplicity of demonstration, consider d = 1, and for a given time a, we want
to know the frequency of a signal f given by Ff, and one might naively do this
by letting 6 > 0. and using the indicator function
1 ifte [x-6,2+6]

Npe-srvay(t) =
0 otherwis


and consider taking the transform of f - xj2-s,2s) instead and letting 6 + 0.
Unfortunately, this will give us a meaningless result via Uncertaintly Principle [7],
which says that a function and its Fouricr transform cannot be simultancously
compactly supported. In particular, for this problem, as the support f - Xj2-5,2+5)
‘concentrates’ about x, as 5 -» 0, the support of F(f - xjr-s2+s}) ‘widens’ in at
least an inversely proportional manner to 6 [7], therefore the idea of measuring a
localized time and frequency by this naive method is almost meaningless in the
sense that a crisp view of the signal in time will give you a vague view in frequency.

Signals arc intractable to strict simultancous time and frequency localizations
as described above, but time-frequency analysis has developed a standard tool
that can still approximate the method which we will demonstrate for d = 1. Let
g € L>(R) be a continuous function that decays syinmetrically in R about 0, the
canonical example for this would be the Gaussian function g(x) = e~**". For a
given signal f, the product f -g gives a transformation of f that is approximately
localized in the origin x = 0. This approximation is in general due to f -g being
not compactly supported but it still captures the local values of f near 0, which
in turn is duc to the smoothness and fast symmetric decay of g. Hence for any
time a € R, we have an ‘x—localized’ f given by ¢ ++ f(t) - g(t — x). Taking the
Fourier transform of this localized signal gives a two-variable function F(r,w) =
Ja f(t) - g(t — z)e-?*"")dt which we interpret as the frequency distribution of f
about «. The resulting two-variable function F(z,w), in terms of both time and
frequency, is one of the standard tools used in time-frequency analysis. It is called
the Short-Time Fourier transform denoted for any f.g € L?(R") by V,f. where g
is called the window function. The Short-Time Fourier transform will be discussed
and studied in depth in this work.

Just like the classical Fourier scrics, it is possible to recover a signal f discretely
via the Short-Time Fourier transform, for this, Ict us introduce the w-modulation
operator M, : g++ g-e"-) and the translation operator T; : f(-) 4 f(-— 2)

There are established theoretical results in time-frequency analysis. of our partic-
ular interest are the Gabor frames. A Gabor frame is a family of time-frequency
shifted single window function sampled on well-structured lattice points in the
time-frequency plane. It can be shown that these Gabor frames have the property
of perfect reconstruction as in (1) where cy = Vyf(tn-we) and gn = Mun Ten9
{19]. While simple and thcorctically pleasing, Gabor frames are not practically
suitable for addressing realistic signals. To see why this is so, we go back to the
fact that the Short-Time Fourier transform is not exempt from the fundamental
restrictions imposed by the Uncertainty Principle, it only allows us to select an
appropriate window, if g is nicely concentrated in the time domain, then in gen-
eral, we get some ‘Ieakage’ or poor resolution in the frequency domain of f and
vice versa. Because of this, we have another localization issue, take for example
the one dimensional case of any realizable signal which may have parts of high
frequency short pulses, and parts of sustained and well-defined sinusoidal waves as
it evolves in time. We obviously nced different windows for these cases, for short
pulses: we need a short window function and rapid sampling in the time domain.
Conversely, for sustained waves, we need long windows, and sparse sampling in

the time domain. In general, while it can do perfect reconstruction, the rigidity

of Gabor frames which uscs a single window function is a poor choice of tool for

the task of adaptable signal representation [1].

Window design and sampling for adaptive time-frequency systems is still an
area of active research [1]. Our goal in this study is to contribute to the breadth
of knowledge in the area by constructing a candidate for a gencral locally adaptive
time-frequency system. To be precise. select a family of countable compact scts
{Qy},ea that cover the time-frequency plane R™ that satisfies some properties for
well-behavedness. Now if for cach A € A, Fy C Q, are sets of finite points inside
each compact set. and gy are window functions associated with each compact set,
we will prove that subject to some technical considerations, we have the following

reconstruction for all f € L?(R¢):

L= 0 Yes Teagn (2)

AEA (1, wr JEPa
for some sequence of coefficients {¢s,r},ea. One can see that equation (2) embodies
what we want for a locally adaptive discrete representation in the context of time-

frequency analysis. Going back to one dimensional example, suppose we choose

cach compact set 24 to correspond to cach region of interest, those in which there's

a short pulse or a long sustained component. Then our representation says that we
can assign appropriate window functions ga in which to pecr inside these regions,
by finite samples Fy C 25.

Establishing that a family of functions in a Hilbert space satisfy two inequal-
ities called the upper and lower frame inequalities arc sufficient conditions for
perfect reconstructions in the space. This result from frame theory is central to
time-frequency analysis, and the bulk of this study is devoted to establishing that
these inequalities hold in the function space which models our signals. This work
rests upon the results made by M. Dérfler’s quilted Gabor frames [9] in which
the author has already made half of the work by showing that an upper frame
inequality hold for a construction very similar to ours, except that the author
initially required that the samples come from pre-existing Gabor frames. We will
show that this assumption is not necessary, and that the upper frame inequality
will still hold. We also make extensive use of H.G. Feichtinger and W. Sun’s den-
sity techniques from their paper Sufficient conditions for irregular Gabor frames
[13] to construct a lower frame inequality for our locally adaptive representation.
We also dedicate a chapter for frames derived from relevant sampling techniques

which are probabilistic in nature.

This study is structured as follows:

The first chapter is roughly a review of basic time-frequency analysis, which in-

cludes classical Fourier analysis, Short-Time Fourier transform, and frame theory.
The remaining two sections include discussion and recollection of known results
on time-frequency localization operators and the amalgam spaces.

In the second chapter we prove our main result. We will also discuss and prove
some technical results regarding the point of view of secing sampling points in
R~ as multiscts, and how we recover our usual notion of unordered sequences by
properly indexing multisets. Furthermore, we derive a multiset characterization
of relatively separated points. We then proceed to show that M. Dérfler’s upper
frame inequality holds for our construction, and subsequently show that using
density techniques and an added hypothesis on the regularity of the diameter of
our compact regions. we can derive a lower frame inequality for our locally adaptive
representation.

In the third chapter we use the techniques and results by G.A Velasco on

relevant sampling [26] (o construct other locally adaptive frames by combining

a

it with frames by ‘finite replacement’ [9] and localized frames by time-frequency
operators [27].

Lastly, all results with proofs that appear in Chapter 2 and 3 that are shown
without citation are original work, or are established theorems but which are
proven independently by the author, or are similar results but are proven under
slightly different hypotheses. Chapter 1 is a review, and most results are known
and cited. Some proofs or details are provided in the Appendix section, both for
results that are known and original. The Appendix serves as a basin for technical
details which are important, but may break the flow of the paper.

Chapter 1

Time-Frequency Analysis

We dedicate an introductory chapter to review basic results on time-frequency
analysis, We start with a short section on Fourier analysis as background material.
The reader interested in an in-depth study is directed to the following texts (15,
5, 19].

1.1 Fourier Analysis

Fundamental to Fourier analysis is the Fourier transform, which we define below.
Note that for the rest of the study, we work with the usual Lebesgue measure and
L*(R‘) for 1 < p < 00 is the Banach space

integration on R¢ = R x Rx
ates ;
of all measurable functions f : R’ + C such that the norm |Ifllp = (Jp lfl?)*

is finite. We have a similar definition for p = 00, where we consider the essential

x

supremum norm [|f|leo = esssup,eg« |/(!)|. For any Lebesgue measurable set MC
R¢, we denote its Lebesgue measure by |M1|. Let X be a normed linear space with
two norms ||-||, and ||-||2 on it. If there exist C,,C2 > 0 such that for any x € X,
Cillz|le < |Iell: < Callz||2 then the two norms are said to be norm equivalent, and
we write |[-[l1 < |||. Note that given a mapping p : X + X wherein ||p(-)||2 is
anorin for X it is convenient to use the notation: for any x € X, |[zl|1 = |lo()Ile
to mean |] - ||, = {Io(-)Il2- This notation should not be confused to mean that =
is a pointwise relation between different points in X. Onc can just think of this
notation as using any z € X as test points in which the norm relation = holds
uniformly in X.
‘The definitions and results here can be found in (19, Chapter 1].

where


Chapter 1. Time-Frequency Analysis 7

The usual interpretation of (1.1), is that given a signal, modeled by the function
f, its Fourier transform f encapsulates the information on the function's frequency
spectrum. The Fourier transform is an operator between functions spaces. This
result is outlined as a lemma of Riemann-Lebesgue.

Lemma 1.1 (Ricmann-Lebesgue). If L'(R*), then f is uniformly continuous and
limy-so0 Lf (w)] = 0.

From the lemma above, and from the fact that by taking the absolute value
of (1.1), we have ||/lloo < |[fll1- Therefore, the Fourier transform F is indeed an
operator F that maps L'(R*) to Co(R4), where Co(R*) is the space of continuous
functions in 4 that vanish at infinity.

While F is initially defined to be an operator acting on integrable functions,
we can extend its definition to L?(R*)

Theorem 1.2 (Plancherel). If f € L'(R*) M L2(R¢) then

Ilflle = Ilflle-

Consequently, F extends to a unitary operator (hence continuous) on L?(R") that
satisfies Parseval’s formula: for all f,g € L?(R*)

(f.9) = (f.9)- (1.2)
Theorem 1.3 (Inversion Formula). If f,f € L\(R¢), then for allz € R"
a= fl fwe’ar. 13)
Fe) = [ feenrae (13)
That is, F-! = IF, where T is the reflection operator If (x) = f(—2).

The inversion formula above is only given for L'(R*) functions, but it can
actually be shown that it is equivalent to Plancherel’s Theorein 1.2. This would
allow us to show that the inversion formula is also valid for the L?(IR“) extension of
the Fourier transform. Again, F can be extended to L?(R*) via density arguments,
in particular by noting that L’(IR¢).L7(IR*) is dense in L?(R“) (24], if f € L?(R")
and {fe}een is a sequence of functions in L'(R“) 9 L7(R*) such that limy-soc fr =
f in L2(R")-norm, then as one would probably see in a proof of Plancherel’s
Theorem. the extension of F can be defined to be Ff := limpsoo F fy. Note that
for any k EN. fy € Co(R") © L'(R4) by Ricmann-Lebesgue Lemma hence the

Chapter 1. Time-Frequency Analysis 8

equivalence of the inversion Formula and Plancherel’s theorem, and the continuity
of F, and Z as operators on L1(R4) would imply that

F(LF f) = FIF jim fi, =

lim F(ZF fi) = jim FF" fe = Jim fr = f.

Similarly we can show that (F)Ff = f, and since the sct of unitary operators
acting on a Hilbert space to itself form a group under composition, then we see
that by uniqueness of inverses, F-! = IF as well for L(R4).

The inversion formula above is a continuous representation of a signal f in
terms of its frequency spectrum f. For discretely periodic functions, say Z* periodic
functions on R¢ so that f(x +n) = f(z) for any 2 € R¢ and n € Z¢, therefore for
any y € RY, there exists an x € (0, 1)¢ and m € Z# such that f(y) = f(x + m),
thus periodic functions in Zé are fully characterized by their values in (0, 1]¢. The

following Theorem gives us a discrete representation for such functions

Theorem 1.4 (Fourier Series). Let f € L?((0.1)*) C L?(R¢) be Z4-periodic and

Moreover, we have

Some technical note for this Theorem: the n-th Fourier coefficient as defined
above in (1.4) is reminiscent of the in (1.1) for functions in L'(IR4). However as
outlined in Plancherel’s Theorem 1.2, for gencral functions in L?(IR‘), it is defined
via density argument. But in (22] it was shown that the same formula above
is exactly the Fourier transform for the smaller space of functions in L((0, 14)

which are Z*-periodic, therefore this fact j

Time-frequency analysis is concerned mainly with representations of signals

or functions that simultancously carry information about the distribution of their

time and frequency. In this study we consider the dis

te time-frequency repre-

sentation of functions in terms of the Short-Time Fourier Transform.

Chapter 1. Time-Frequency Analysis 9

1.2 Short-Time Fourier Transform

In this section, we discuss the main tool of time-frequency analysis, namely, the
Short-Time Fourier transform. We list here some of its most important and useful
Properties whose proofs can be found in [19, Chapter 3]. It can be defined in terms

of the two fundamental operators, the translation and modulation operators.

Definition 1.2. Let x,w € R! and f : IR“ + C. The translation and modulation
operators on L?(R‘) to L?(R*), givon by T; and AM, respectively, are defined by

T.f(t) = f(t - 2); (1.7)
Muf(t) = fe", (1.8)

where t = (t,...,ta),w = (w1,..wa) € R¢ and (tw) = 4, t;- wy is the usual
Euclidean inner product on R‘. For any z,w € R*. their composition M,T; is
called the time-frequency shift operator, which we also denote in short-hand by
M,,Tz for any z = (x,y) € R',

(2) = m(x,w) :

IfR*x R¢ is interpreted as the time-frequency plane, and a function f : R¢ 3 R
is interpreted as a signal propagating in the time axis R“, then (1.7) can be seen
as a time shift operator. For the modulation operator (1.8), it is similarly seen as

a frequency shift, although it is not apparent from its form.
Proposition 1.5. Let (z,w) € R’, f € L(Y). Then
F(Maf) =ToF f, (1.9)
F(T; f) = MaF f. (1.10)
It is now apparent from Equation (1.9) that modulation is indeed a frequency

shift since its behavior under the Fourier transform becomes a translation. We

also note the adjoints of these operators are time and frequency shifts as well.
Proposition 1.6. For any z.w € R", the adjoint of Te is T-; and the adjoint of
Ma is Mo.

Now, it is important to note that these two operators do not conmute, and it

is casily verifiable by simple computation that

TM. Ho) NLT. (1.11)

Integrals over the whole space arc translation invariant, and in general, for 1 <

p < oc the translation operator is an isometry on L?(R4). It is also obvious that

Chapter 1. Time-Frequency Analysis 10

modulation is an isometry on L”(RY) because |e] = 1 for any C € R. The

time and frequency shift operators are important because they arc the basis of

time-frequency analysis. D. Gabor, in his paper Theory of Communications (17),
proposed the use of time-frequency shifts of the Gaussian function as a building
block to reconstruct any signal. In the subsequent discussions of this chapter, we
will provide some of the results in which this can be done, and we will also sketch
some extension of this idea.

Related to the two fundamental operators is the Short-Time Fourier transform,
which we define below.

Definition 1.3. Let g : R¢ + C be a nonzero fixed function in L?(R¢). Then the
Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT) of a function f € RY with respect to g is
defined for all (z.,w) € R™ as

Vestas) =f OgE= ae? de. (0.12)

The function g is also called the window function. From this definition, we can
also sec that

VoF (t,w) = (fr MaT=9) 12(R24) (1.13)
= F(f Teg) (1.14)

The representation given by (1.13) shows the immediate connection between
translation and modulation operators and the Short-Time Fourier transform using
the inner product on L?(R%4). The representation given in (1.14) makes it casy
to see what exactly the Short-Time Fourier transforin is trying to do. Ideally, g
is a continuous function that take values in R¢ and has symmetrical decay about
the origin, hence f - Tag essentially localizes f about x. Therefore, provided that
the window function g is nice enough, we can think of the Short-Time Fourier
transform as a workaround for the non-existent instantaneous frequency spectrum
of f about x due to the Uncertainty Principle [7]. From this perspective, we

see that the Short-Time Fourier transform is a simultancous time and frequency

representation of any signal f, and thus it is considered @ primary tool for time-
frequency analysis. Also, note that we will henceforth omit distinctions on inner
products for different spaces, whenever the context: is clear cnough. Below is a

result which lists down the important properties of the STFT.

Another corollary to the orthogonality relations (1.16) is given below.

Corollary 1.11. If f,g € L°(R‘), then

1I¥of lle = Il lellgll2-
In particular, éf |\gll2 = 1, then the operator V, : L?(IR*) -+ L(IR%) is an isometry.

The above result also says that Vy is a bounded operator. Since it can easily
be shown to be linear, then we can always find a unique continuous operator
Vj : L2(R™) + 17(R4) that defines the adjoint of V,. We will use vector-valued
integrals to find the adjoint of the Short-Time Fourier transform (see Appendix).
First, note that for a fixed window fimction g € RY, and F € L?(R™), we have
that (c,w) > F(z,w)-M.Tsg is a mapping from R to L2(R4). Since L2(R¢) is
reflexive, then f = [fou F(x.w) -MuTrg dedw € L?(R*). We have the following

theorem.

Just like the classical in Fourier transform, the STFT allows for continuous

If each x € R* and w € R¢ are seen as points in the time and frequency plane axes,
respectively, then the equation above shows that we can ‘continuously sample’ the
whole time-frequency plane where each point in the plane (2,) corresponds to a
time-frequency shifted window function g, given by M.,Tzg. What (1.23) says is
that, we can recover the original signal f by ‘continuously summing’ up all M,T.9
with V,f(x,w) acting as coefficients. Furthermore, the usual interpretation is
that the coefficients V, f(x,w) are the time-frequency content contributed by the
support supp(M.Tz9) © R¢ of M.Tzg. Thus, the representation given by the

STFT inversion formula is highly redundant since one can always find points
(z1,w;) and (%z,wz) in the whole time-frequency plane such that the supports of

Mu,Trg and M,Tx.9 have a large overlap [19]. One of the main problems in time-

frequency analysis is to discretize the representation given by (1.23), sampling only
a countable number of points, say T := {(tn,wn) : 2 € N} C R™ in which the

discretized STFT inversion formula holds for all f € L?(R") :

such that the supports of each time-frequency shifted window function My,,T,9

with cach other is minimal.
Before ending this section, we define an important space of functions connected

with the STFT called the the modulation space So(R").

Definition 1.4. Let 90 e7*lkI” be the Gaussian function in R¢. Then the

modulation space So(R“) is a normed linear space with norm || -|Is, given by

So(R") = {f € L?(R*) : [If llso == IIVonSli < 00}.

That is. Sp(R4) is the space of functions which has integrable STFT with

respect to the window finetion go.

Chapter 1. Time-Frequency Analysis 14

Example 1. — The following shows that go itsclf is in So(IR¢) [19].
Let us note that the Fourier transform of a Gaussian function is a
Gaussian function as well, in particular, F(e~?*l#I)(w) = go(w) (19,
Lemma 1.5.1]. We have

Where we used equation (1.7) for the last line, and the fact that the
Fourier transform of a Gaussian is a Gaussian. The last line above
(1.25) is again, a Gaussian function with some complex multiple, and
therefore, it must be integrable in R™4.

Some important results for this space can be found in [14], we are particularly
interested in the result pertaining to the independence of the Modulation spaces

to the Gaussian function.

Proposition 1.14. The Gaussian function go is itself in So(R¢). Furthermore, if

In light of this result, we can Iet go to be any fiction in So(R¢). Some sufficient
conditions from [18, 14] are outlined in the result below:

Proposition 1.15. The following are sufficient conditions Jor any f € L?(IR*) to
be in So(R*):

1. f € L1(R*) and f has compact support.

2. f-tws, fw, € L2(R4), where w.(z) = (1+ |||), s > d.

1.3 Frame Theory

In this section, we discuss frames, a theorctical tool that is used to study the

conditions for the existence of discrete time-frequency representations of signals.

We first define what a frame is. An in-depth discussion of frames and some of

basic results can be found in [19, Chapter 5 & 6].

Chapter 1. Time-Frequency Analysis 15

Note that we also make use of the following concepts and notations on the
subsequent discussions. If T is a bounded linear operator on a complex Hilbert
space . then T is called positive if and only if for all x € H, (Tz,)y is real and
nonnegative. Furthermore, for two positive operators Ty, and T; on H. we write
T, < Tp if and only if for all x € H, 0 < ((Tn —T;)2,2)4-

Definition 1.5. A sequence {¢;};eu in a Hilbert space H is called a frame for 1

if there exist positive constants A,B > 0 such that for all f €

AIP SSO Kf.es)P < BILSIP- (1.26)

je
Any two constants A, B satisfying the above inequalities are called frame bounds.
While the inequalities above may scem unassuming at first, it’s apparent con-
nection to discretization can be scen by studying it along with the three following

operators.

Definition 1.6. For any sequence {e;}jes © H, the analysis operator C is given
by

CS = {(f.e)}se7- (1.27)

The synthesis operator D is defined for a finite sequence ¢ = (¢;);es by

De =~ cje; € H, (1.28)

and the frame operator S is defined on H by
SI =D fedes- (1.29)
The first result of this section deals with the basic properties of the operators

above.
Proposition 1.16. Suppose that {cj : j € J} is a frame for H.
1. Cis a bounded operator from 1. into €(J) with closed range.

2. The operators C and D are the adjoints of each other. Consequently, D
extends to a bounded operator from (J) into H. and satisfies

Chapter 1. Time-Frequency Analysis 16

3. The frame operator § = C*C = DD* maps . into H. and is a positive
invertible operator satisfying Aldy < S < Bldy and Bu'Idy < S-! <

Av"Idy, where Idy is the identity operator on 1.

Next we define what it ineans for a series to converge unconditionally. This
will allow us to extend the notion of convergence in 1. concerning frames as in
equations (1.28), and (1.29), and see that they behave particularly well. The
following result is important, because it tells us exactly how any series made up
of frames converge, we have the following

Theorem 1.17. Let {e;}jeg be a frame in H. If f = Dye, cses for somec € CJ),
then for any bijection m : N -+ J, the sequence of partial sums >, Cm(n) fnn(n)
converges to H, that is, Dj, cye; converges unconditionally to f.

From the theorem above, we can see that frames are permutation invariant as
a serics, provided the coefficients are in ((J).

The next result ties up frames and the discrete representations of signals.

Theorem 1.18. If {e; : j € J} is a frame with frame bounds A,B > 0, then
{S-e; : 7 € J} is a frame with frame bounds B-!,A-! > 0, the so-called dual

frame. Furthermore, every f € 2. has expansions

F= LU Seses, (1.31)
and
f= DilfeS ey. (1.32)
ja

where both sums converge unconditionally in H.

In this study, given a countable index set 7, and I = {(a;,w;): 7 € J} CR,
we generally refer to T as a sampling set and any collection of functions of the
form {hj : j € J} as discrete time-frequency systems. Theorem 1.18 above now

gives us a sufficient condition to look for if we want a discretization like (1.23).

More precisely, if we have a single window function such that hy = Mu,T;,g for

all j € J, then we are looking for the existence of constants A. B > 0 such that

AIMIB S$ S01, MayTs, 9)? $ BILL. (1.33)

sed

Chapter 1. Time-Frequency Analysis 17

In simpler terms, we want a {M,,Ts,9 : j € J} to be a frame for L?(R*). The set
{M.,T:,9 : | € J} =: G(g,T), a discrete time-frequency system of time-frequency
shifts of a single window function is called a Gabor system, and a Gabor system
that is a frame, is called a Gabor Frame. From the discussion above, even if one
can find such a frame, it is in general, hard to find an explicit form for the inverse

frame operator S~!, hence we only have

£= SOF SMa, Ta,9)) Ma Tay 95
je

f= SOF Ma,Te,9)S7 (Ma, 7,9)
ies

The case when the sampling set is a lattice is well studied. A lattice is a countable
subset of R™ of the form MZ™ where M € Mzz(R) is a nonsingular matrix. In
particular, when M is a diagonal matrix such that MZ?! = aZ x 6Z*, then it is
called a regular lattice, and sampling points of such a form arc also called regularly
sampled points. For Gabor systems sampled on regular lattices on R? (d = 1) of the
form 9(g, 0,8) = {TaxMpag : (k,n) € Z?}, with window g = 2/4e-*** € 1?(R):
G(g,T) is a frame [19] if and only if @- # < 1, furthermore, there exists [19] a
77 € L7(R*) such that S-"(Tax.Mpng) = Tox pny, therefore

L£= SO Uf. ToxMpng) Tor Min:

(kn)ez?
£= SO (Tow Mpn) Tor Mang. (1.34)
(kn)ez?
Equation (1.34) is exactly the discretized version of the STFT inversion formula
(1.13) whenever (9,7) = 1. It is only off by a complex exponential factor due to
the commutation relation (1.11).

In this study, we do away with the nice structure of lattices. and work with non-
lattices or irregularly sampled points in the time-frequency plane. We also consider
working with multiple window functions, where in principle, each sampling point
corresponds a window function. That is, we want to know what are the necessary
conditions for an arbitrary sampling sect T = {(xj.w,) : j € 7} with associated
windows {g, € L?(R¢) : 7 € J} such that there exist A.B > 0 where for any
f € LA(RY), we have

Chapter 1. Time-Frequency Analysis 18

We reiterate that the case of Gabor frame can then be taken to be a special case
of this, when all the sampling points correspond to a single window function:
9; = g. Onc of the primary contribution of being able to find such a frame is on
adaptive representation of signals. This is easily seen in audio signals [3, 8, 1]
which might be made up of different components over time (think of an ensemble
or orchestra) which might require different time-frequency resolutions. Due to the
Uncertainty Principle, long sinusoidal components cannot be clearly depicted by
Short-Time windows, and similarly, components with high frequency or of rapid
pulses cannot be depicted by long-time windows. The usual Gabor systems have
this fundamental problem as their single window function cannot be used for such
an adaptive signal analysis. A comprehensive discussion on a possible construction
of such a frame will be done in Chapter 2.

1.4 Time-Frequency Localization Operators

In this section, we discuss the time-frequency localization operators which was
introduced by I. Daubechies in [6], and studied further by D. Bayer [2] as part of
his dissertation on pseudo-differential operators.

For the rest of the study, we denote the support of a function f : R¢ > C on
R¢ by the supp f = {z € R?: f(x) #0}. Where S for any set S C RY denotes the

closure of S in R¢

Definition 1.7 (Time-Frequency Localization Operator). Given a symbol  €
1P(R%), (1 <p < 00), and window functions 1,2 € L?(R4), the time frequency
operator HY'“* for a function f € L7(R*) is defined using the STFT and its
adjoint via

Hg" f = V3 (0 -Vorf)- (1.36)

In this work, we will be using the spectral properties of a compact operator.

Definition 1.8. If X and Y are Banach spaces and T : X + Y is linear, then T
is said to be compact if and onlly if for any bounded subset B C X, the closure of

its image under T, T(B), is compact in ¥

Operators that are compact and self-adjoint have a well-known spectral prop-

erty [25, Theorem 4.24]. and we will this result primarily in Chapter 3 where

frames are constructed using the eigenvalues of the time-frequency localization

operators.

Chapter 1. Time-Frequency Analysis 19

Theorem 1.19 (Spectral Theorem for Self-Adjoint Compact Operator). Let H
be a Hilbert space with C as its underlying field and T : H +H be a self-adjoint
compact operator. Then there exist an orthonormal set {e; : i € 1} where the
index set I is either N or {1,2,...,k} and a sequence (A;)ier € C which converges
to 0 such that

span (e; : i € I)* = ker(T).
Moreover, for all x € H, Tz = Dye; x(x, €%)ex with unconditional convergence.

The result [2, 3.1.6] below gives the basic boundedness estimate for the time-
frequency localization operator:

Proposition 1.20. The time-frequency localization operator is a continuous, self-
adjoint mapping from L?(R*) to L?(IR*) satisfying the following norm estimate

WAS"? file < Ilallp -Ihealle  Ilvelle - Ilfll2- (1.37)

Note that (1.36) can be written formally in terms of an integral using the
definition of Vj,, which is

Hew f= i If 5g Tp (208) Me Trtpatir da. (1.38)

where (1,w) € R™, If we have o(z,w) = 1 everywhere with (y;, 2) = 1, then

via the inversion formula, H?”? = Id on L2(R4). Of our particular interest is
when the support of the symbol ¢ is contained in a compact sct inside the time-
frequency domain. In this case, we interpret H?!-?? f as the part of f in the inverse
Fouricr Transform that is ‘truncated’ on the set of the support of @. To sce this,
consider the particular case for a compact set 2 in the time-frequency domain R™!

in which o = x9. This gives us
Hef = i if Vor F (tw) MuTeprdzdw.
ln

If the symbol o has a compact support in R%, then the time-frequency localization

operator is compact [2, 3.1.7] as well. We state it as a theorem below.

Theorem 1.21 (Compactness for Symbols with Compact Support). Let o €
L?(R"), (1 < p < 00) such that suppo is compact in R™, and gi. € L?(R%).

then Hg"? is a compact operator on L?(R*).

Chapter 1. Time-Frequency Analysis 20

In this work, we are mainly interested in symbols of the form xq € L™(IR*“)
where xq is the indicator function on a compact subset 2 C R”™ of the time-
frequency plane. Since such symbols are compactly supported with supp xa = 2,

then H¥'"? is a compact operator. Therefore. we can apply the Spectral Theorem
1.19 on Hewe2,

1.5 Amalgam Spaces

In time-frequency analysis, we are also intcrested in functions satisfying certain
properties locally, in which those local properties can be combined to obtain a
global property of the function. Spaces containing such functions are appropriately
called amalgam spaces, since they consist of functions whose amalgamation of their
local and global properties satisfy some finiteness criterion. We will define what
these spaces are preciscly. We refer the reader interested in a thorough discourse
of amalgam spaces to the papers by H.G. Feichtinger (12, 11]. For amalgams on
the L?, and &7 spaces as what this chapter is based on, we refer the reader to
the papers [16, 20]. We will be proving most of the results here, while some are
relegated to the Appendix. Most of the proofs appearing here are patterned on
C. Heil’s techniques [20], where he worked on the amalgams on R,

Definition 1.9. Let 1 < p,q < 00, and L?,,(R*) be the space of all functions
f R= C such that for any compact sct 2. RY. [If “xallinea < 00. Given a
compact set 2 with nonempty intcrior, we define the amalgam space denoted by
W(L?, L4)(R*) to be

W(L?, L4)(RY) = {f € Le c(R") = |] IF + xoselleel|,¢ < 2} - (1.39)

The definition is well-defined as the space is independent of the compact set 2.
Below is a result on the completeness of the amalgams spaces. Its proof is deferred

to the Appendix.

Theorem 1.22. W(I?,L9)(R‘) is a Banach space with norm
[lfllweecey = || IF = xesellie||,.- Furthermore, different choices of the compact

sets 2 with nonempty interior give equivalent norms.

We are also not strictly restricted to L? spaces. in fact it is possible to define
amalgam spaces W(B, C) for arbitrary Banach spaces B.C satisfying certain con-

ditions [12]. But for the purpose of this study, we are only interested in subspaces

Chapter 1. Time-Frequency Analysis a1

S? of the L” spaces which has the norm induced by L”. Precisely, we consider the

space
W(S?, L4)(R!) = {fF € Ly.o<(R*) 9 S°(R") : |[flwes.u9 < 00},

equipped with the norm induced by W(L?, L’).

From the definition, we can quickly prove familiar inclusion relations for the
local L? components. Notc that for normed functions spaces, (A, |]-||4); (B; II-[Is)

Therefore our conclusion follows. For g¢ = 00. the result easily follows by taking

the essential suprommn of the inequality (1-41). o

An analogous inclusion result for the global components is stated below, but

we defer its proof to the Appendix, which follows from the elementary inclusion

relations on the discrete €” spaces.

Another result, showing the behavior of the amalgam spaces when p = q is

shown below.
Proposition 1.27. W(L’, L’)(R®) = L7(R*).
Proof. We have for any f : R¢ + C

IARyunsey = ff, eOPrnee atte = fa-+21 IU = 1 I
Hence, W(L?, L”)(R*) = L?(R"). The same can be done when p = cc. ao

The Amalgam spaces also inherit the monotonicity property of L? spaces. that

Proposition 1.28. For any 1 < p,q < 00, if |f| < |g| almost everywhere, then

proof for p,q = oo is similar. fs)

Next, we discuss the structure of the amalgam space when we consider, as a
local component, a closed subspace of L?.

Theorem 1.29. Let 1 < q < p < 00 and S? C LP be a closed subspace, then
W(S?, L*) + W(L?, L4) and W(S?, L*) is a closed subspace of W(L?, L*) (hence
a Banach space).

Proof. Since the norm on $? is induced by L”, it is straightforward to see that
W(S?, L*)(R¢) + W(L?, L4)(R"). To show that W(5?, L*)(R*) is closed, let
{Jn}nen be a Cauchy sequence in W(S?,L*)(R“), then by completeness of
W(L?,L9)(R¢), there exists an f €  W(LP,L9)(R4) such that
. then by (1.26), we have

such that ||gllz» < Kllgllwu.19) for all 9 € W(L?. L%). In particular, this means
that {fu}nen is a Cauchy sequence in S?. Furthermore, limyso llf — fallur <

W(L?, L9)(R*) as well. Oo

From the two preceding results along with Proposition 1.29 and Theorem

(1.24), we immediately have the following result

Corollary 1.30. If 1 < pi < m2 < 00, and S* C L™ is a subspace, then
ws, L9)(R*) > W(L, L*).

As what can be seen above, functions in W(L”. L")(R“) are characterized by
the L? integral of their local L? norms with respect to the translates of any compact
set with nonempty interior. We shall show an equivalent norm on the space
W(L", L")(R*) and prove that the amalgam space can be discretized where the

‘global’ L7 norm can be replaced by the discrete ( norm.

Chapter 1. Time-Frequency Analysis 24

The theorem above allows us to consider a simpler norm for the Amalgam
spaces by considering the BUPU generated by the family {xo,, :n € Z4}, with
Cn = 6n + 6(0,1)*, where n € Z" and 6 > 0. It can quickly be checked that these
functions satisfy items 1— 3 of Definition 1.10, with supp(xo,,s) = nd + 6{0, 1]
and with 6(0, 1]* standing in for U in the definition so that supp(xc,,s) = nd + U.
It can also be shown that for any bounded set K C R4, supmezs #{n € Zt:
(K +6) (K + mé) 4 0} < 0 (see Appendix). This characterization of the
Amalgam space will allow us to simplify computations in the proceeding chapter.
Also, note that by the above theorem, different values of 6 > 0 also give equivalent
norms. Furthermore, note that we can also replace item 1 of definition 1.10 with
Die i = 1 ae., and the proof will still remain valid, hence we can actually
consider the closed intervals C,,,s = dn + (0, 1]*.

also make up a frame for R24, then we call it a quilted Gabor frame.

Since for each region Q,, we are only using finite local sampling points 2, 9
Am(r), then it seems natural to think that we may be able to relax the requirement
that we sample cach local systems from existing frames. That is, we are looking
for conditions on the coverings 2, and how to select finite points in it that we can

This problem is almost the same as Dérficr’s construction, only that we do not
assume a priori the existence of cach Gabor frames associated to the compact
sets 2). We will show that an upper frame inequality still holds even without this
assumption. Furthermore, our main contribution is the proof on the existence of
the lower frame bound as in incquality (2.1) above using the density techniques
from H.G. Feichtinger and W. Sun's paper on irregularly sampled Gabor frames
{13}.

2.2 Multisets and Density Results

We first address a subtle point about sampling in the Time-Frequency plane by
quilting. In Dérfler’s quilted Gabor frames and our initial hypotheses above, we
are dealing with regions that cover time-frequency plane and we sample from
points inside these regions, so in general, after quilting we end up with unordered
and possibly repeated sampling points. Therefore, it is more appropriate to look
at our sampling points as multiscts instead of just scts or sequences since they
are the natural generalization of sets that are sensitive to repetitions, and ignores
ordering.

We begin by a definition of multiscts themselves and then defining the opera-

tions between them.

Definition 2.2. A multisct is a pair (5. js) whore S is a set called the underlying
set and jis : S + Nyo is a mapping to the strictly positive natural numbers called

Chapter 2. Existence of General Adaptive Irregular Gabor Frames 30

the multiplicity function for S. For s € S, the natural number p(s) is called the
multiplicity of s.

Note that when there is no confusion, we shall refer to the multiset (S, js)
simply as S.

To allow comparison and to define operations between multisets, we need to
extend the range of the multiplicity function to include 0, and the domain to a
larger set as in the following definition.

Definition 2.3. Let U be a fixed set called the universe such that A C U and
Ha be the multiplicity function of A. Extend a : A > Noo to the mapping
pa: U + Noo by pals) =0 if seU\ A.

Note that this definition implies that ordinary sets are just multisets with
multiplicity functions bounded above by 1. Also, two multiscts (S, ys) and (A, ya)
are cqual if and only if under a universe U, such that A,B CU, ps = pa.

Definition 2.4. Let A, B € U be underlying sets contained in a common universe
with multiplicity functions jz, 4», respectively. Comparisons and operations be-

tween inultisets are defined as follows:

(i) We generalize the notion of sct inclusion, the multiset B contains A denoted
by AC B if and only if for all 2 € U, palz) < pa(z);

(ii) The intersection of multiscts A and B is the multisct with underlying set C
characterized with the multiplicity function given by zo(x) = min(y.4(2'), fea (x))
for x € U;

(iii) The union of multisets A and B is the multiset with underlying set C charac-
terized with the multiplicity function given by ue(t) = max(u,(z), we(2))
for z €U;

(iv) The sum of the multiscts A and B is the multiset with the underlying set C

characterized by the multiplicity function po(:t) = a(x) + pen().

We are mainly interested in the sum of multisets which we will denote as Aq: B
for multisets A and B. For example, if we have the finite multisets {1,1,2,3.4}
and {1,2,3,4,4} then {1.1,2,3,4} ® {1,2,3,4,4} = {1,1.1,2,2.3,3,4,4, 4}.

Now that we have the definition of multisets down, we define the notion of

relatively separated mnultisets, which are originally defined as sequences in [A].

Chapter 2. Existence of General Adaptive Irregular Gabor Frames 31

Note that we strictly differentiate from sets and multisets in the sequel to avoid

confusion.

Let us also discuss how to properly index multise

s. Let (S, zs) be a multiset
and given an index set A, let f : A + S be the surjective indexing function. We
say that f is a proper indexing for the multiset (S, ys) if for all a € S, |f-'(z)| =
us(z). To construct such an indexing, let Z = Ures{(2, nz) 1 < nz < pis(z)} and
define the surjective function f : I+ S via (x,nz) 4 «.

Definition 2.5. Let A be a set, and (5, 1s) be a multiset.

(i) A set A is separated if inf, serra |a — b| > 0; A constant 6 > 0 such that
Ja — b| > 6 for all a bin A is called a separation constant.

(ii) A multiset 5 is relatively separated if it is a finite multisct sums of separated

(iii) A point \ € R™ is an accumulation point for a set of multiset (5,12) if
every open ball in R™ centered at A contains infinitely many points in the
underlying set of (S, us).

Note that a set, say A, which is separated, must not contain any accumulation
point, since if it does, then infa,s¢A:a¢6 [a — b| = 0. This observation can be gener-

alized to multisets by the following proposition.

Proposition 2.6. A multiset is relatively scparated if and only if it has no accu-

mulation points and has a bounded multiplicity function.

Proof. Let (S.us) be a relatively separated multisct. so that (S,jus) = @%,S;
where cach S; are separated sets. Since separated scts are, by definition, sets.
And sets necessarily have multiplicity functions bounded by 1. then for all « € S,

\ns(z)| = [0% s,(2)| < NV, hence the multiplicity function jzs is bounded. Now

suppose for contradiction that (S, zs) has an accumulation point \ € R, then by

definition, there exists a sequence {Ax}xenw © S = UN, S; such that JA — Ag] < 4.

But since the sequence {Ax}xenw is infinite and there are only finite S;’s, then at
least one of the S;’s must contain an infinitely many terms of the sequence {Ax }xens
which is a contradiction since this will imply that one of the separated sets S; will
have an accumulation point.

Conversely, assume that (S.jzs) has a bounded multiplicity function and has no.
y= No.

accumulation points. Therefore there exists No € N. such that sup,ey fas(2"

Chapter 2. Existence of General Adaptive Irregular Gabor Frames 32

Assume also that (S, js) docs not have an accumulation point, therefore, any
subset of the underlying set S$ cannot have an accumulation point, meaning any
subset of 5 is also a separated sct. Now, for convenience, Ict us define the multiset
operation n - (M, ym) = @/,M = (M,n- yy), so if M is just an ordinary set,
then n- M is just the multiset with clements in M repeated n times.

Next, for each t € N we define the subsets $; C S via S; := {x € S: s(x) = i}.
Hence 5; consists of elements of S with multiplicity exactly i. Thus by hypothesis
we can write (5, zs) = S,® (2-52) @ (3-53) ®...®(No + Sno) because for any s € S
such that js() = i where i € {1,2,..., No}, s(x) = i-jus,(z) and 1s,(ct) = 0 for

J #1. Since (S,us) has no accumulation points then each S; is a separated set,
hence (5, ys) is a relatively separated multiset. ia)

With the proposition above, we can now show that

Lemma 2.7. Let {Qa},en be an admissible cover and Fy C Qy be arbitrary fi-
nite points for each index X, then the multiset @yeq Fa is a relatively separated

multiset.

Proof. The regions {Q,},¢a constitute an admissible cover of the R plane, there-
fore the number of intersections of cach region with the others is bounded above,
that is, there exists Np such that for all A € A, given * := {r € A: 2,2 ¥ B},
then #* < Np. Therefore, the multisct @,¢q Fy has a multiplicity function

bounded by No. Furthermore, eq Fy cannot contain any accumulation point
in R™. Let z € R4, by hypothesis. it can only be contained in a finitely many
compact sets {Qy},eq, otherwise we contradict the admissibility condition (since z
will then be an intersection point of infinitely many %s). Let {9,}, be all such
compact sets that contain z, and let d := diain(J, Q),), then the open ball Ba(z)
of z contains the set UN, {M,}, and hence by construction, Ba(z) contains only at
most the finite points Uf, Fs, thus z is not an accumulation point of @yeq Fa-

Since z is arbitrary. @yeq Fa does not have any accumulation point. o

This point of view of multisets is implicit in the current literature dealing with
possibly repeated sampling points [9] [4], and we recover the usual notion of frames
if we take any proper multiset indexing. That is, if J “ S$ where J is an index
set, S is the underlying set of a multiset (S, 15) and m is the surjective mapping

that defines the indexing, then we say that multisct (S, jes) is a frame for a Hilbert

Since we can always do this, and ordering is irrelevant in frames, our multiset
formulation just reduces to the usual frames in terms of ‘sequences’.

2.3 Existence of the Upper Frame Bound

In this section will we prove that an upper frame inequality holds for our construc-
tion. The serics of results below for this section is mostly due to M. Dérfler [9]
but we nevertheless show it here, some with slight difference in their hypothesis,
and we note that it holds even without the assumption of the existence of any
Gabor frame, while also taking into consideration the point of view of multisets
as developed in Scction 2 of this chapter.

We first. give a slightly different convolution formula from [19, Lemma 11.3.3]

which will be an important inequality for our forthcoming estimates.

This shows us that for uniformly well decaying window functions inside cach
region, we can actually choose any finite sampling points inside each compact

region to quilt a system with an upper frame bound.

2.4 Existence of the Lower Frame Bound

Our next step is to show a sufficient criteria for the existence of a lower frame
bound. For the sequel, we work with the same construction, that is, the sct
of windows gy still has uniform decay, but we add another stipulation that our
compact sets 2, behave in a controlled manner, in particular, supyeq[Diam®,] <
co. In other words, we do not let the local components grow arbitrary large. We

start with the following definitions and lemmas.

Definition 2.2. Let n € N. C is a rectangle in R" if C = []j_, Ze where cach
I, are intervals in R. A rectangle C is degenerate if at least one Z, is a singleton
interval. If cach of the intervals are bounded, then we call C a bounded rectangle

in R®. A rectangle is closed (open) if every Z, is a closed (open) interval.

Remark:
The interscction of rectangles is a rectangle. This follows directly from
the fact that intersections of cartesian products is the cartesian product

of intersections.

Lemma 2.12. Let n € N, for any rectangle C in R", |C| = 0 if and only if C is

either degencrate or emply.

Chapter 2. Existence of General Adaptive Irregular Gabor Frames 37

Proof. Suppose |C| = 0 and C is nonempty. By definition of the Lebesgue measure
on n-dimensions, |C] = |Zi| - |Z2| - ... - [Zn] = 0, which implies that at Icast one
Ty, say, Iv has measure zero. Since C is not empty, then nonce of the intervals Z,
is empty, including Z,, this implies that Zy is a degencrate interval, since every
non-empty and non-singleton interval has positive measure. From the definition
above, it must be that C is a degenerate rectangle.
The converse is trivial since empty sets and singletons have zero Lebesgue measure.
a
Corollary 2.13. Let n €N, for any two rectangle C and C’ in R", |CNC'|>0
if and only if CNC’ is non-degenerate and non-empty.
Proof. This follows directly from the Lemma above, and from the fact that the

intersection of rectangles is also a rectangle. a

Lemma 2.14. Let n € Z and q € Z". Define Dy := q +(0.1]". Then for any
bounded non-degenerate and non-empty rectangle C in R", CC Uteicnn,is0) Do

Proof. We prove a simpler result. Consider a,b € R such that a < b, then there
exists k € Z such that k < a and k+(0, 1]M(a, b) is non-degencrate and non-empty.
Indeed, if a € Z, then choose k = a so we have the non-singleton and non-empty
intersection k + [0,1] (a,b) = (k,b) if0 <b—a <1, or k+ (0, 1]A(a,b) = (k, k+1]
ifb—a>1. Ifa ¢ Z, we can always choose some k € Z such that k <a<k+1
in which k + [0,1] (a,6) = (a,k +1] fk +1 <b, or k + [0,1] (a.b) = (a,b) if
k+12> b. Hence, once such a k is found and k +1 < b, we can intersect the ‘next’
interval (k + 1) + [0,1] to (a,b) to get a non-cinpty non-degencrate interval and
keep going until we cover all of (a,b). By the previous corollary, we have shown
that (a,b) © Usrensetto.sjn(a.y>0)(4 + (0, 1]). The result can easily extended to
any bounded non-degenerate non-empty interval (not just open intervals). Since
C = JI, Ze where each Z; is a bounded non-degenerate non-cmpty interval in R,
then we can apply the previous result to each of these Z;’s from which our lemma

follows. a

The next theorem is a result regarding the density of sampling points in the time-
frequency plane R and families of rectangles that cover it.

Theorem 2.19. For each X€ A, let Ey be a finite family of rectangles that cover

such that py € Ex Qs. If supyeq{Diam 2g] < oo. then the multiset Byea Fr is a
uniformly 5—dense set for L?(R°*) for some 5 > 0.

Consequently, given a family of windows {g, : 4 € A} C Hye, then for a
sufficiently small 6. the multiset ®yea{t(Pa)ga : Pr € Fa} is a frame for L?(R%).

Proof. Let D := sup,e,[Diam ,] < 00. Hence we have

We now show that @ye, Fa is 2r—dense. That is, we show that

Usea Unser, Midi l(pa)s — §,(ra): + §), then any rectangle of side length 6 will

Pn € Ey to be pa = py € Fy for some d € A. Also, let gn = g, whenever Pa = Pr.
Therefore by Lemma 2.18, as 6 + 0, we get have a lower-frame bound A’ > 0 such

This shows that for ‘well-bchaving’ regions that cover the time-frequency plane,

it is possible for such an ‘adaptive’ frame to exist by taking points inside sufficiently

dense ‘grids’ E, MQ, in cach local regions.

Chapter 3

Adaptive Frames via

Relevant Sampling

In this chapter, we consider randomly sampled points that are also localized inside
a compact region of the time-frequency plane. We will also extensively use the
spectral theorem for self-adjoint compact operators 1.19. In particular, given a
time-frequency localization operator H defined with a compactly supported sym-
bol, then it is a self-adjoint compact operator H : L?(R*) + L?(R4), and we can
always write f = 72, (f,e)ee + Frer where fier € Ker H and {(px, ox) }%21 are

the cigenvaluc-cigenfunction pairs of H in its spectral decomposition as given in

Theorem 1.19. We can also always write Hf = 072, ax(/. 7%) ex. Furthermore if
Vw = span{y, : k= 1,2,..., NV} C L7(R4) and Py, : L?(R“) + Vy is the orthogo-
nal projection operator onto the closed subspace Vw, then Py f = Dhar (fs Px) Pe:

We start with the following lemma adapted from G.A. Velasco's paper on

relevant sampling [26].

Lemma 3.1. Let Hag := H§” be the time-frequency localization operator with
respect to the compact set 2 C R? such that |Q| > 1 and window y € So(R?)
such that ||p|l2 =1. Furthermore, let {an}nen be the (decreasing) sequence of real
eigenvalues of Hog. Let N EN, 7 € [aws1,an], and Fy © Q be a set of finite
points inside Q. Let Vy © ImHay be the subspace of L*(R) given by the span
of the first N eigenfunctions of Ha, and let Pyy be the orthogonal projection
operator onto Vy. Let g € L?(R) be another window function such that ||gll2 = 1.
If the inequality

where 7 > v > 0, holds for all p € Vy, then there exist A.B > 0 such that for all

The theorem follows since the projection operator Pyy is self adjoint. o

Remarks

1. If we replace f € L(IR) with p € Vy in the theorem above, then by the
self-adjointness of Pyy, {Py 7(A)9},em is a frame for Vy.

2. Note that the v in (3.1) can always be replaced by another v’, possibly a

larger one, so that the value of A in (3.2) can be controlled.
3. The number +y depends on N.

In [26], G.A. Velasco has shown that with a high and controllable probability, a
sufficiently dense set of local random samples inside Q, satisfies (3.1). With this,
we can use the sampling inequality given by (3.1) to construct locally adaptive
frames from randomly sampled points in the time-frequency plane.

An immediate application of the result above can be found in conjunction
with the existence theorem from [10, Theorem 5.10] which says that under certain
conditions, for a family of time-frequency localization operators H” over regions
2, © R? with common windows y € So(R) and eigenvalues {Pf }xen, one can
choose N, € N such that there exists C,D > 0 such that for all f € L?(R)
CIPI S$ yea Dien MP YEP S DILSIB. This equivalent norm, along with the
relevant sampling result by Lemma 3.1 can be used to give a modified version of

27, Theorem 4.10], which also constructs a localized time-frequency plane.

Theorem 3.2. Let {H* : « € A} (where A is a countable index set) be a family
of time-frequency localization operators H" = H$;¥ over compact subsets Q, CR?
respectively with a common window function ¢ € So(R) such that ||y|lz = 1. For
each jp € A, let {(yil,ax,)}%1 be the cigenvalue-eigenfunction pairs of H" in

its spectral decomposition. Suppose further that the compact regions satisfy the

Chapter 3. Adaptive Frames via Relevant Sampling 48

following: 2 < infyer |Qu] < supyen|%u| < co and there exist Ap, Ba > 0 such
that Aa S Dye Xa, S Ba.

Corresponding to each u € A, N, € N are chosen such that there exist C, D > 0
such that for all f € L?(R*) CILFIR S Dye Dees UP YEIP < DILFIIB. Choose
also a finite, relatively separated subsets F,, C Q, that satisfics the hypotheses
of Lemma 3.1 with respect to N = N, respectively such that 0 < inf,ea{an,},
0 < infyea(#F.) S SuPyea(#Fy) < 00 and windows g* € L?(R) where ||g"l[2 = 1.
Then the system Byca{Pry,™(A)9"}aren, is a frame for L7(R).

Proof. By hypothesis, the collection of the eigenvalues {an,}yea has a positive
lower bound, so for each js € A, we can choose, in light of Lemma 3.1 a >

% > O such that yy — Yu < supyea|Qy| and invent — %} > 0. Hence we
choose A := Mucal#Farintventm—¥s} and this choice of A implies that if we choose

incquality is summed in p over A. ia)

Next we show a result by Dorfler [9], and we'll use it to show that a finite
number of clements in a Gabor frame can be replaced with a finite number of
time-frequency shifted windows that are not necessarily a frame for L?(R) to

generate a new frame.

Theorem 3.3. Let G = {g;: i € Z} be a frame for L?(R4), and F, CT be a finite
subset. of Z. and {hj : j € Fa} be any finite number of elements in L*(R").

Let A, be the lower frame bound corresponding to the frame G and Cr,, Cr,
be the corresponding analysis operators for {g; : i € Fi} and {hj : j € Fa}
respectively. If there exists a bounded linear mapping L : @(F,) + @(F2) such
that

then the set

is a frame for L?(IR¢) with a lower frame bound given by (Ay—2K)/ max(1, 2\|L"|\*).

We now present the main theorem for this chapter. Given a (Gabor) frame
G(g,A) for L2(R), and a compact subset 2 C R®. Replacing the sampling points
in Fy = ANQ with a different ‘randomly’ chosen finite sampling points Fz C 2
which satisfies 3.1 can still yield a Global frame for L?(IR), provided the sequences
in &(F;) obey a certain inequality.

Theorem 3.4. Let G(g,A) be @ Gabor frame for L?(R) such that ||gll2 = 1 with
lower frame bound A, and let 2 CR? be a compact set with finite points Fy = QN
A. Suppose further that 2 and Hoy satisfy the hypothesis of Lemma 3.1 for some
N EN and for some finite points Fz 9. with accompanying window function
h € L>(R) such that ||h||2 = 1, that is, by remark on Lemma 3.1, {Puy (u)A} ners
is a frame for the subspace Vy  . Furthermore, if for all ¢ = {c,}aex, such that

Ilclls =1, the inequality given by

its inverse. We are going to usc the previous theorem, so we define the operator L :
OF) + C(Fr) via c = fexhaers 9 ((Caex Prw cat), 87) Pry TMD) ners
which can easily be scen to be linear since Py, is linear and because scalars
distribute. We now show that it is also bounded.
