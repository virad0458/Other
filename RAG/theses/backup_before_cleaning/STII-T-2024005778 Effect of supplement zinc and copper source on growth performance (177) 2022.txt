ABSTRACT

In weanling pig diets, zinc and copper are essential trace minerals that serve as
growth promoters and can regulate the intestinal microflora and reduce diarrhea associated
to post-weaning period. Two studies were conducted to determine the effect of
supplemental zinc (from ZnO) and copper (from CuSO₄) on growth performance, diarrhea
incidence and fecal color in nursery pigs (Study 1) and to evaluate the effect of different
copper sources on growth performance, diarrhea incidence, fecal color and intestinal health
in nursery pigs from a Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea-infected herd (Study 2). In Study 1, pigs
fed zinc oxide + copper sulfate combination had lower (P=0.021) diarrhea score among the
diets. There were no significant differences in diarrhea days and frequency among the
dietary treatments. Pigs fed with copper sulfate diet has a darker (P<0.001) fecal color
among the dietary treatments based on the subjective and objective fecal color. In Study 2,
there were no significant differences in diarrhea score, days, and frequency among the
treatments. However, diarrhea score positively correlated (P<0.001) with mortality.
Copper source did not affect growth performance, small intestine morphology, and the
gene expressions of insulin-like growth factor 1 and occludin. In conclusion, zinc oxide +
copper sulfate combination has an effect in diarrhea incidence caused by post-weaning
diarrhea. However, in the presence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, copper source or
antibiotic was unable to reduce diarrhea incidence. Regardless of the method to determine
fecal color and the copper source, nursery pigs fed diets with pharmacological levels of
copper have darker color.

INTRODUCTION

The post-weaning period is considered stressful for pigs due to changes in behavior,
social and physical environments, health, and immunology (de Andrade et al., 2016;
Debski, 2016; Li, 2017). There are several factors considered that causes diarrhea in
nursery pigs. Nutritionally, nursery pigs, with a limited digestive capacity, initially have
diets consisted exclusively of sow milk, which is then replaced by plant-based diets, will
adapt to this new condition with morphological changes in the gastrointestinal tract, such
as shortening of intestinal villi, deepening of crypts, and changes in organ weights, such as
the small intestine. These changes increased the occurrence of diarrhea and a reduction in
weight gain due to the reduced ability of weanling pigs to digest food and to absorb
nutrients (de Andrade et al., 2016; Debski, 2016; Li, 2017). Enteropathogens such as
Escherichia coli, a pathogenic infection, is another factor that causes post-weaning diarrhea
(PWD) which is one of the major challenges impairing gut health in nursery pigs (Sun and
Kim, 2017; APHIS-USDA, 2002). The infection of £. coli in nursery pigs may induce
diarrhea resulting in dehydration, reduced weight gain, and death (Sun and Kim, 2017) and
various antimicrobial growth factors (AGPs) are not only used to treat sick animals and
prevent bacterial infections, but also to enhance the growth performance of the animals.
However, due to the intensive use of AGPs, the frequency and antimicrobial resistance
have been observed, and consequently resulted in AGPs being banned for use in the
European Union, South Korea, and USA (Hao et al., 2014; Pig International, 2014; Sun

and Kim, 2017). However, with the increasing incidence of E. coli-associated diarrhea and

resistance to antibiotics, there is an urgent need to develop alternatives to conventional
AGPs. More recently, another major cause of diarrhea are viral diseases such as Porcine
Epidemic Diarrhea (PED), which is caused by a virus and has similar clinical signs as pigs

infected with E. coli but with greater rates mortality and morbidity (The Pig Site, 2018).

In weanling pig diets, zinc and copper are essential trace minerals that serve as
growth promoters (Pig International, 2014; Shelton et al., 2009) and have the ability to
regulate the intestinal microflora and reduce diarrhea associated to post-weaning period
(Pig International, 2014). Weaning may result in reduced mucosal villus height and
increased crypt depth of the intestinal epithelium (mucosa) as well as changes the digestive
enzyme activity in mucosa and pancreas (Blaabjerg and Poulsen, 2017) and intestinal
barrier dysfunction and mucosal inflammation (Hu et al., 2013). Zinc is involved in anti-
inflammation, anti-diarrhea, and restoration of mucosal barrier integrity. Increased Zn
concentration in the intestines influences their structure and function. Increased height of
small intestine villi in comparison with the depths of crypts was observed in pigs (Debski,
2016). Research has also shown that increased dietary zinc can increase growth rates and
decrease incidence of diarrhea after weanling, and dietary copper enhance growth rates
both in weanling (Jacela et al., 2010) and growing pigs (Shelton et al., 2009). At
pharmacological levels, research on combining zinc oxide (ZnO) and copper sulfate
(CuSO,), the most common form of zinc and copper, respectively, are limited but a few
have shown growth rates similar to those when ZnO is used alone (Shelton et al., 2009;
Debski, 2016). High doses of dietary ZnO have shown to support a large diversity of

coliforms in weaned piglets, to reduce the susceptibility of pigs to E. coli infection, and to

reduce fecal counts of lactobacilli and enterococci during the post-weaning period, but only
temporarily. A clear decrease in the total number of anaerobes and lactobacilli and an
increase in the number of coliforms in ileum samples from animals fed a ZnO diet was
observed and the use of CuSO, in weanling diets was reported to specifically reduce the
number of streptococci in fecal samples and lactobacilli (Hojberg et al., 2005). The
commonly used copper source, CuSOs, is supplemented in excess to improve intestinal
health, although there are other forms of Cu currently in the market such as tribasic Cu
chloride (TBCC) with a higher concentration of Cu compared to CuSO, (58 versus 25%)
(Cromwell et al., 1998). This characteristic of TBCC as an alternative source of Cu could
be investigated. Another major reason for the use of supplemental copper in many nursery
pig diets is its effect in changing fecal color, wherein farmers associate a darker feces color
with better diet digestibility and quality. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is
no published study evaluating the independent effect of supplemental copper sources on

fecal color and the interaction with supplemental zinc in nursery pig diets.

Objectives of the Study

The general objective of this study was to determine the effect of supplemental zinc
and copper source on growth performance, diarrhea occurrence, fecal color and intestinal

health of nursery pigs.

Specifically, the study aimed:

Study 1. Effect of Supplemental Zinc and Copper Source on Diarrhea Occurrence
and Fecal Color of Nursery Pigs

1) To determine the effect of supplemental Zn (from ZnO) and Cu (from CuSOs) alone
and in combination on diarrhea incidence and fecal color of nursery pigs; and

2) To determine the correlation between diarrhea incidence and fecal color.

Study 2. Effect of Supplemental Copper Source on Growth Performance, Diarrhea
Occurrence, Fecal Color, and Intestinal Health of Nursery Pigs in a Porcine
Epidemic Diarrhea-Infected Herd

1) To determine the effect of dietary supplementation of different sources of copper on
growth performance, diarrhea incidence, fecal color, and intestinal health of nursery
pigs in a Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea (PED)-infected herd; and

2) To determine the effect of dietary supplementation of different sources of copper on

gene expression levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and tight junction

proteins related to small intestinal integrity.

REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE

Use of Antimicrobial Growth Factors (AGPs)

Different type of stress inflicted by the conditions of modern commercial pig
production were associated with significant negative impact on the gastrointestinal tract
(physiological, microbiological and immunological) which led to decrease in growth and
feed efficiency, and increase diarrhea occurrences. PWD is one of the most common causes
of economic losses in pig production (Debski, 2016). Antibiotics were extensively used in
pig production to minimize all these negative changes, which caused numerous bacterial
strains to develop antibiotic resistance. Therefore, in 2002, pig producers in Denmark
voluntarily abolished all use of AGPs in pig feed (Debski, 2016), and the European Union
(Regulation No. 1831/2003) banned the use of non-medicinal use of antibiotics in livestock
production in 2003 (Pig International, 2014; Debski, 2016). Ban of antibiotics, used as
growth promoters, has caused a need for alternatives to conventional antimicrobials in
swine diets. Traditionally included in high doses to piglet diets, zinc oxide and copper salts

seems to possess the highest efficacy as growth promoter (Debski, 2016).

Effect of Zinc and Copper in Nursery Pigs

Zinc is the second most abundant transition metal in biological systems (Cho et al.,
2015). It is an essential nutrient which plays an important role in growth, cell proliferation
and differentiation, and functions in various Zn-dependent enzymes and other proteins as
a catalytic, regulatory and/or structural component. Some common Zn deficiency
symptoms are low appetite, poor growth and diarrhea. The recommended Zn level in
piglets fed with conventional diet is 80 ppm (NRC, 2012), however, several research
showed that high dietary Zn supplementation (2500-3000 mg/kg diet) during the first two
weeks post-weaning reduces diarrhea in piglets. Zn is needed to be absorbed systemically
as correlated to an increase in serum Zn at a level of 0.2 mg Zn/100 mL (Blaabjerg and
Poulsen, 2017). Zinc is stored in the body in small amounts, and in a form which is directly
available for use in physiological functions in the body, which means that pigs will have
no source of Zn if the intake of the element with the feed is reduced and too low. Thus,
daily intake of sufficient Zn is necessary. Phytic acid forms complexes with the Zn and Cu
which reduces the availability of the elements. This may affect the nursery piglets after
weaning since their diet will shift from a milk-based diet to a plant-based diet which are

rich in phytate.

Copper is part of various enzymes (Blaabjerg and Poulsen, 2017) and is
substantially involved in processes concerning iron utilization and synthesis of connective
tissue (Uchewa and Nwaebor, 2015). The recommended Cu level in pigs is no greater than

5 to 6 ppm (NRC, 2012) but in pig production, it is common practice to use high

concentrations of dietary Cu, up to the limit imposed by the European Union (Commission
Regulation (EC) No. 1334/2003) (Blaabjerg and Poulsen, 2017). Cu contains some
antibacterial properties, but there is a lack of scientific evidence to explain its exact mode
of action to that resulted in its growth promoting effect. Other researchers have reported
that rather than antimicrobial effect, Cu enhances growth through a systemic effect in the
intestinal tract (Pastorelli et al., 2014). In conventional reared piglets, supplementation of
high Cu concentration (283 mg Cu/kg diet) increased growth and gain:feed and improved
the villus height:crypt depth ratio. Furthermore, copper is usually supplemented at a higher
dose to compensate dietary factors that could reduce its absorption (Agga et al., 2014).
Reduction on microbiota, especially the population of clostridia and coliform bacteria, was
observed even at low concentrations (<50 mg/kg diet) of dietary Cu supplementation, while
reduction of the lactobacillus population was observed when higher concentrations (>170

mg Cu/kg diet) were supplemented (Blaabjerg and Poulsen, 2017).

Challenges in Supplementing Zinc and Copper in the Nursery Pig Diet

Zn and Cu are usually used in animal feed in excess concentration, in higher levels
compared to nutritional requirements of the animals and for prevention of diarrheal disease,
and also as an alternative to in-feed antibiotics for growth promotion (Yazdankhah et al.,

2014).

Development of resistance to Zn and Cu. In farmed animals, enteral bacteria

(both commensal and pathogenic), have been shown to develop resistance to trace elements

such as Zn and Cu (Yazdankhah et al., 2014). An increase of multi-resistant intestinal
bacteria (E. coli) was observed when piglets were fed with high concentrations of dietary
zinc (2,425 mg Zn/kg diet) after weaning (Ciesinski, 2018). As Zn-tolerance is linked to
antimicrobial resistance, high dietary Zn feeding may increase the occurrence of
antimicrobial resistance. An increased prevalence and persistence of methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus was associated with feeding of pharmacological Zn levels and
recent publications connected the Zn concentration in liquid pig manure with phenotypic

antimicrobial resistance in E. coli (Ciesinski, 2018).

In addition to elaborate chromosomally mediated Cu handling mechanisms among
E. coli, Cu resistance is mediated through a plasmid-borne copper (pco) resistance cluster
consisting of seven genes: pcoABCDRSE. There is a growing concern that heavy metals,
such as Cu, help to maintain and expand the pool of antibiotic-resistant bacteria through
co-selection (co-cross-resistance mechanisms) (Agga et al., 2014). Transferable Cu
resistance (trcB) in enterococci, isolated from piglets, calves, poultry as well as in humans,
has previously been found to be associated with tetracycline (tefM), macrolide (ermB) and
glycopeptide (vanA) (pig origin) resistance genes (Agga et al., 2014; Yazdankhah et al.,

2014).

Environmental pollution caused by Zn and Cu supplementation. In areas with
intensive pig farming, heavy metals such as Zn and Cu tends to accumulate in soil and
surface waters, thus may cause serious environmental pollution (Pastorelli et al., 2014;
Debski, 2016; Ciesinski, 2018). Increased excretion of Zn and Cu could be a potential

problem in off-site nurseries where weanling piglets are farmed year around.

Supplementation of CuSOs at the level of 250 mg Cu/kg feed in nursery pigs caused 14
times increase of fecal copper excretion. In Denmark, national monitoring study revealed
that current use of Zn and Cu for pig production may pose environmental pollution and a
serious risk to aquatic animals (Debski, 2016). Adverse environmental effects, like
impairment of plant production, accumulation of these metals in water supply chain and
induction of antimicrobial resistance may be some of the causes of increased heavy metal
emissions. However, introduction of new, more efficient compounds and/or forms may
provide feasible alternatives to in-feed antibiotics and their reduction in inclusion level

(Debski, 2016).

Chemical Characteristics of Tribasic Copper Chloride

Tribasic copper chloride (TBCC) contains several chemical characteristics that is
suitable as a Cu source in pig diets. Compared with >99% Cu solubility of CuSOs in water,
TBCC has <1% Cu solubility. In a weak acid environment (0.4% HCl, 2% citric acid, or
neutral ammonium citrate), Cu from TBCC is highly soluble (100%). Furthermore,
according to Cromwell et al. (1998) the TBCC has low hygroscopicity (0.43% weight gain
in 24 h at 90% humidity versus 4.6% weight gain for Cu sulfate) and it has very low
chemical reactivity (-25 mV when | g is suspended in 40 mL of isopropanol versus 130
mV for Cu sulfate). When TBCC was added to the mixed feed, certain degradation of
vitamin and other organic compounds were reduced due to these chemical characteristics

(Cromwell et al., 1998).

Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus

Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea (PED) is caused by a coronavirus named Porcine
Epidemic Disease virus (PEDv). There are two different types of PEDv, the PEDv Type I
that only affects growing pigs while, PEDv Type II affects all ages including sucking pigs
and mature sows (The Pig Site, 2018).

Clinical signs, lesions, pathogenesis. It is particularly age-specific and has a
severe effect on younger animals. Infected nursery pigs may go off feed for two to four
days, have loose feces or watery diarrhea and dehydration is common (Jung, et.al, 2016;
and The Pig Site, 2018). E. coli scours is one of the other diseases that have similar clinical
sign (The Pig Site, 2018). There may be high morbidity and affected animals may be
severely ill. Although recovery usually follows, there may be some mortality and
unexpected deaths (Iowa State University, 2022). Villi in the small intestine of piglets are
atrophic and some are fused with the adjacent villi (Iowa State University, 2022). PEDv
replicates in the cytoplasm of villous epithelial cells throughout the small intestine, causing
severe necrosis or apoptosis in target enterocytes. Villous atrophy and vacuolation occur
as a result of these processes, as well as a significant decrease in enzyme activity. This
series of events disrupts the digestion and absorption of nutrients and electrolytes, resulting
in watery diarrhea and severe and fatal dehydration (Lee, 2015).

Causes. PEDv is largely spread by the fecal-oral route, and infected pigs shed
massive amounts of the virus for seven to nine days after infection. Transmission can occur

directly through contact with infected pigs or indirectly by exposure to contaminated pig

11

feces, which can last up to a month in cool, wet organic materials. PEDv can also be
transmitted through the air, through sperm, through blood plasma, and indirectly by
vehicles and fomites.

Prevention and control measures. Strict biosecurity, which prevents PEDv from
entering pig farms (fattening and farrowing units) by minimizing the introduction of any
material or person that could come into contact with the virus, is one of the most critical
approaches for preventing and controlling acute PED outbreaks. To achieve this, all
fomites, personnel, and external visitors who could be contaminated with PEDv must be
completely disinfected (Lee, 2015). Vaccines are currently available in the market,
however, the current variant vaccine strain available may not satisfactorily protect the
animals from PEDv due the mutations of the virus which produce new strains (Gao et al,

2021).

Quantitative Real-time PCR

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is a method to determine the amount of the
PCR product in real-time and is a powerful tool for investigating gene expression. It does
not rely on any downstream analysis such as electrophoresis and is able to assess multiple
PCR targets simultaneously (Maddocks and Jenkins, 2016). The introduction of a
fluorescent reporter molecule in each reaction well allows for real-time detection of PCR
products, with increased fluorescence as the amount of product DNA increases. To monitor
the fluorescence signal as amplification occurs, a specialized thermal cycler with

fluorescence detection is needed (Bio-Rad, 2022).

12

Several studies were conducted to identify possible host pathological response to
PEDv using qRT-PCR. Zong et al. (2019) investigated the relationships among the tight
junction protein gene expression in a normal and PEDv-infected pigs. They observed that
compared with the control group, the overall expression of the genes (ZO (Zonula
occludens)-1, ZO-2, Occludin, Claudin-1, Claudin-4, and Claudin-5) showed downward
trend in infected PEDv. In particular, the expression of Occludin and Claudin-4 genes was
significantly decreased (P<0.01).

Zhang et al. (2019) investigated the gene expression profiles of nutrient transporters
in the small intestines of PEDv infected pigs and their metabolism. The following are some
of the results Zhang et al. (2019) discovered from the experiment: there was a decrease
(P<0.05) in the mRNA levels for genes associated with water and ion transport (e.g.
aquaporin (AQP) 3, AQP4, AQP8, AQP10, potassium inwardly-rectifying channel
subfamily J member 13 (KCNJ13), glucose transporter-2 (GLUT2), transient receptor
potential cation channel subfamily v Member 6 (TRPV6), sodium/hydrogen exchanger
(NHE) 2, and NHE3) caused by PEDv infection, while there was an increase (P<0.05) in
the mRNA level of sodium/glucose co-transporter-1 (SGLT1). In regard to the expression
of genes related to lipid transport and metabolism, PEDv infection also down-regulated
(P <0.05) fatty acid binding protein (FABP) 1, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), apolipoprotein
(APO) Al, APOA4, APOC2, solute carrier family 27 member 4 (SLC27A4), solute carrier
family 27 member 2 (SLC27A2), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and long-chain acyl-CoA

synthetase 3 (ACSL3), while increasing (P < 0.05) FABP2 mRNA level in the jejunum.

13

Zhou et al. (2021) explored the role of glucagon-like peptite-2 (GLP-2) gene in
regulating PEDv infection and repairing the damage to the intestinal mucosa caused by
PEDV infection. GLP-2 is a specific intestinal growth hormone that promotes the repair of
damaged intestinal mucosa and improves the intestinal barrier. GLP-2 gene was expressed
in the 3 segments of the small intestine. In jejunum and ileum of piglets with damaged
intestinal mucosa, the mRNA level was significantly down-regulated and when GLP-2
gene was silenced, the copy numbers of PEDv were increased. The results suggest that
GLP-2 gene may have a role in controlling PEDv infection and in maintaining the integrity

of the intestinal mucosal barrier structure.

Insulin-like Growth Factor 1

Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is an important mediator of enterocyte
proliferation and differentiation (Shen et al., 2014). Aside from stimulating proliferation
and apoptosis inhibition in fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells, IGF-I also
increases collagen expression and production in each of these cells (Kuemmerle, 2012). It
is 147,227 bp in length found at chromosome 5 (NC_010447.5) of the pig genome. IGF-1
is closely related members of the insulin superfamily of peptide hormones and share ~40%
amino acid identity with insulin. Different from insulin, IGF-1 is not produced and stored
only in B-cells of the pancreatic islet. It can be synthesized and secreted by many cells in
the body in a highly regulated manner, including cells in the gastrointestinal tract and liver

(Kuemmerle, 2012; Shen et al., 2014). The intestinal smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal

14

tract is also a rich source of IGF-1, and to regulate cell growth and survival, acts in an

autocrine and paracrine fashion.

Tight Junction

Tight junction (TJ), a network of proteins that connect epithelial cells, plays a
crucial role in maintaining gut barrier function. One of the key proteins of TJ, occludin, is
consistently associated with barrier function (Shen et al., 2014). Modulation of occludin
interactions enhances the porosity of the tight junctions allowing molecules to penetrate
biological barriers (i.e. blood-brain barrier and intestinal mucosa barrier) (Kiptoo et al.,
2013). Occludin is a four transmembrane-spanning protein of ~65 kDa with a short N-
terminal and a much longer C-terminal region which are both exposed in the cytosol, only
a single gene exists (Kramer, 2016). It contains numerous phosphorylation sites, which are
directly related to substance permeability (Prager et al., 2017). It is 52,261 bp in length

found at chromosome 16 (NC_010458.4) of the pig genome.

Reference Genes

Reference genes are an internal reaction control having different sequences
compared to the target genes, its expression level is unaffected by the experimental
treatments and should have minimal variation between tissues and physiological conditions
of the organism. Basic metabolism genes, called housekeeping genes, may fulfill these

conditions and they are involved in processes essential for cell survival and the expression

15

level is constantly stable and nonregulated (Kozera and Rapacz, 2013). Normalization is
done to adjust the differences in the quantity and quality of the starting material and
differences in RNA preparation and cDNA synthesis (Nygard et al., 2007; Wang et al.,
2018). To obtain accurate and reliable gene expression results, it is a critical step to select
the appropriate reference gene for data normalization (Nygard et al., 2007; Zhang et al.,
2012; Kozera and Rapacz, 2013).

B-actin. It is 6,109 bp in length found at chromosome 3 (NC_010445.4) of pig
genome and is involved in cell motility, structure, and integrity (Nygard, et.al, 2007;
MedlinePlus, 2013). It is one of the most commonly used reference gene since it has the
most stable range of gene expression across different pig tissues based on the analysis of
Nygard et al. (2007). It is a good housekeeping gene for high abundant transcripts.

GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). GAPDH is also one of
the most commonly used reference gene which is involved in carbohydrate metabolism
and is up-regulated in muscle. Based on the detailed study of Nygard et al. (2007) on the
stability and level of pig reference genes across a various tissue, GAPDH was unstable and
not suitable as a reference gene. It is 5,517 bp in length found in chromosome 5
(NC_010447.5).

HPRTI1 (Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1). The HPRT1 enzyme
allows cells to recycle purine (MedlinePlus, 2007; Nygard, et al., 2007). It is 36,759 bp in
length found in chromosome X (NC_010461.5). HPRT1 is a frequently used housekeeping
gene in different pig tissue (e.g. diaphragm, heart, lung, skeletal muscle, right and left

atrium, left ventricle, and duodenum). However, in a study that assessed a set of reference

16

genes for different tissues (e.g. liver, lung, kidney, spleen, stomach, small intestine, and
large intestine) of different pig breeds (Berkshire, Landrace, Duroc, and Yorkshire),
HPRT1 was the least stable housekeeping gene due to its inconsistent expression patterns
(Wang et al., 2018).

TBP (TATA box binding protein). TBP is involved in transcription initiation
from RNA polymerase II promotor and is a good housekeeping gene for low abundant
transcripts (Nygard et al., 2007). TBP plays an essential role in regulating gene activity and
is active in cells and tissues throughout the body. It binds to TATA box, a particular
sequence found in a regulatory region of DNA near the beginning of many genes. The
DNA segment CAG/CAA trinucleotide is found in one region of the TBP gene. This
segment appears multiple times in a row and within the gene, is normally repeated 25 to
42 times (MedlinePlus, 2008). It is 18,007 bp in length found at chromosome 1

(NC_010443.5).

Effect of Supplemental Zinc and Copper Source on Diarrhea Occurrence
and Fecal Color of Nursery Pigs

Animals, Experimental Design, and Diets

A total of 40 nursery pigs (initially 11.18 kg and 50 days of age, LY x D) was used
in a 21-day trial. Pigs were blocked by initial weight and gender. Each treatment had 8
replications with each pig individually penned. Pigs were housed at the Institute of Animal
Science swine research facilities at the University of the Philippines Los Bajios, College,
Laguna. To prevent stress for the recovering pigs due to a disease outbreak at the IAS farm,
random allocation was not observed.

A total of 5 dietary treatments were formulated (Table 1). The first diet was a corn-
soybean meal diet which served as the negative control (NC). The four other diets were the
negative control diet supplemented with 35 ppm tiamulin and 400 ppm chlortetracycline
premix (positive control, PC), 3000 ppm of zinc oxide (ZnO), 125 ppm of copper sulfate
(CuSO), or ZnO+CuSO,4 combination, respectively. All dietary treatments were
formulated to meet or exceed NRC (2012) nutrient requirement for nursery pigs. The
antibiotic, ZnO, CuSOx, and ZnO+CuSOs combination were added to the negative control

diet at the expense of starch. All experimental diets were fed in meal form.

Diarrhea Incidence

At least 2 independent evaluators assessed visually each day (morning and
afternoon) the diarrhea score of each pen, the score ranging from 1 to 5 (1 = normal feces,
2 = moist feces, 3 = mild diarrhea, 4 = severe diarrhea, and 5 = watery diarrhea). Diarrhea
days were calculated by counting pig days with a diarrhea score of 3 or greater. Frequency

of diarrhea were calculated as diarrhea days over total days in the period = 100.

Fecal Color

Using a subjective color scale from | to 3 (1 = yellowish brown, 2 = brown, and 3
= black), at least 2 independent evaluators assessed visually each day (morning) the feces
color. Feces samples from each replicate pen were collected at day 0, 7, 14, and 21 and was
then uniformly placed in clear plastic for measurement of objective color (L*, a*, b*

values) using a chroma meter (CR-400 Chroma Meter, Konica Minolta).

Statistical Analysis

Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc, Cary,
NC) with pig as experimental unit. Correlation coefficients for the subjective and objective
color scale were determined. REG procedure of SAS was used to generate the prediction
model. Statistical significance and tendency between least square means were considered

at p<0.05 and p<0.10, respectively.

Study 2.
Effect of Supplemental Copper Source on Growth Performance, Diarrhea
Occurrence, Fecal Color, and Intestinal Health of Nursery Pigs in a Porcine
Epidemic Diarrhea-Infected Herd

Animals, Experimental Design, and Diets

A total of 40 nursery pigs (initially 5.89 kg and 50 days of age, LY x D) was used
in a 21-d trial. Pigs were blocked by initial weight and gender and were randomly allotted
to 1 of 5 experimental treatments using a randomized complete block design. Each
treatment had 8 replications (1 pig per pen). Pigs were housed at the Institute of Animal
Science swine research facilities at the University of the Philippines Los Bafios (UPLB),
College, Laguna and during the conduct of this study, there was PEDv infection in the herd.
A total of 5 dietary treatments were formulated (Tables 2 and 3). The first diet was a corn-
soybean meal diet which served as the negative control (NC). The four other diets were the
negative control diet supplemented with 35 ppm tiamulin and 400 ppm chlortetracycline
(positive control, PC), 150 ppm from copper sulfate (CuSO4) or 150 ppm from two
different sources of tribasic copper chloride (TBCC1: XJ-BIO, China; and TBCC2: Agri
Specialist, Inc., Philippines), respectively. All dietary treatments were formulated to meet
or exceed NRC (2012) nutrient requirement for nursery pigs. The antibiotic, copper sulfate,
and tribasic copper chloride were added to the negative control diet at the expense of starch.

All experimental diets were fed in meal form.

21

Production Parameters

Daily feed allotments and individual pig BW were recorded weekly and at the end
of the experiment (day 21). At the conclusion of the experiment, data were summarized
and ADG, ADFI, and F/G were calculated for each treatment weekly and overall 21-day

feeding period.

Diarrhea Incidence

At least 2 independent evaluators assessed visually each day (morning and
afternoon) the diarrhea score of each pen, the score ranging from | to 5 (1 = normal feces,
2 = moist feces, 3 = mild diarrhea, 4 = severe diarrhea, and 5 = watery diarrhea). Diarrhea
days were calculated by counting pig days with a diarrhea score of 3 or greater. Frequency

of diarrhea were calculated as diarrhea days over total days in the period x 100.

Fecal Color

Using a subjective color scale from 1 to 3 (1 = yellowish brown, 1.5 = grayish
yellow, 2 = gray, 2.5 = grayish blue, and 3 = grayish green/black) (Figure 2) which was
generated using the prediction model for b*, and L* from the first study, at least 2
independent evaluators assessed visually each day (morning) the feces color. Feces
samples from each replicate pen was collected at day 7, 14, and 21 and was then uniformly
placed in clear plastic for measurement of objective color (L*, a*, b* values) using a

chroma meter (CR-400 Chroma Meter, Konica Minolta).

Small Intestinal Morphometry

At day 21, four replicates per treatment were euthanized for collection of tissue
samples for histology. About 10 cm of tissue samples from the 3 segments of the small
intestine were callected and stored for histological evaluation. The duodenum samples
were located after the stomach and ileum was located using the ileocecal junction. The
jejunum samples were collected by measuring 30 centimeters from the ileocecal junction.
The gut contents were removed by flushing with saline solution gently and the tissue were
then placed in a 100 ml wide screw-top container with an 80 ml 10% buffered formalin.
For histological analysis, the different intestinal segments were sent to the Veterinary
Histopathology Laboratory under the Department of Veterinary Paraclinical Sciences,
College of Veterinary Medicine, UPLB which provides tissue section preparation. One
slide for each replicate has 2 tissue samples embedded. An average for ten villi height and
crypt depth values from each tissue sample per slide were taken using digital microscope
(Dino-Lite Digital Microscope, AnMo Electronics Corporation, Taiwan) at 55x

magnification.

Molecular Analysis

Total RNA was extracted from frozen jejunal tissue samples using PureLink™
RNA Mini Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The quality of the extracted RNA was determined using spectrophotometer (Epoch2

Microplate Reader, BioTek). Reverse transcription to produce the complementary DNA

25

(cDNA) was performed using SuperScript™ IV First-Strand Synthesis System (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Fluorometer (Qubit® 2.0,
Invitrogen, Life Technologies) was used to quantify the cDNA using Qubit® dsDNA HS
Assay Kit (Life Technologies). Expression levels of IGF-1 and occludin in jejunum were
analyzed by quantitative PCR with Power SYBR™ Green PCR Master Mix (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) on QuantStudio3 (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The
published primers used for the target genes from Shen, et. al. (2014) and the housekeeping
gene f-actin from Wang et. al. (2016) were synthesized by Macrogen, Inc. (South Korea)
(Table 4). The 10y1 qPCR mixture contained 1X of Power SYBR™ Green PCR Master
Mix, 0.1M of each primer and Sng of cDNA template. The PCR cycle profile were as
follows: an initial denaturation at 95°C for 10min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 15s and 55°C and
60°C for Imin (depending on the primer, Table 4). A melt curve analysis was generated to
verify the specificity and purity of the PCR products. All reactions were performed in
duplicate for each cDNA samples. Relative quantification of the target gene with the
housekeeping gene was calculated using 2“‘T method (Schmittgen and Livak, 2008), in
which AACt = ((CTrarget gene — CT housekeeping gene)treatment groups — (CT target gene — CT housekeeping
gene )negative control treatment). Prior to qPCR, conventional PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis
were performed to verify the primers and the amplified products using Tag DNA
Polymerase Recombinant (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The optimized method
for amplifying the target sequence was done by mixing the cDNA template (10ng) in a
20pI PCR reaction mixture consisting of 0.2M each primer pair (Table 4), 0.24M dNTP

mix, 1.5mM MgCl, 1X Buffer, 0.5U DNA polymerase, and water in a PCR tube. The

26

mixture was then subjected to PCR amplification using thermal cycler (Veriti 96 Well,
Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with thermal cycling profile of 94°C for
5min, and 35 cycles of 94°C for Imin, 55°C and 60°C annealing (depending on the primer)
for Imin and 72°C for I min, with final extension at 72°C for 2min. The PCR products were
sequenced by Macrogen, Inc. (South Korea). The sequence results were then aligned
against the pig mRNA using the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) program to

verify their identity.

the random effect. Least square means were calculated for each independent variable. The
diet with a significant source of variation, least square means were separated using the
PDIFF option of SAS and adjusted using the Tukey-Kramer test. The a-level that was used

to determine significance and tendencies between means were 0.05 and 0.10, respectively.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Study 1.
Effect of Supplemental Zinc and Copper Source on Diarrhea Occurrence
and Fecal Color of Nursery Pigs

Diarrhea Incidence

There were no significant differences (P=0.168) in the diarrhea scores of week 1
(Table 6). The diarrhea scores of pigs fed the ZnO+CuSO, combination improved as the
experiment proceeded (Table 6 and Figure 1). From day 8 to 14 and day 15 to 21, pigs fed
ZnO+CuSO, combination had lower (P<0.021) diarrhea score compared to pigs fed the
CuSO, diet. Throughout the experiment, pigs fed the diet with CuSO, had a higher
(P<0.021) diarrhea score. Overall, pigs fed the ZnO+CuSO,4 combination had lower

(P=0.021) diarrhea score among the dietary treatments.

The first week of the trial showed high number of days where diarrhea was

observed (Table 7). As the experiment proceeded, pigs fed the PC diet showed decreasing

diarrhea days and no diarrhea were observed on the second and third week with those fed

the ZnO+CuSO, combination. Pigs fed the NC and CuSO, diet showed a decrease in

diarrhea days from week 1 to week 2; however, there was an increase in diarrhea days on

week 3. Overall, there were one diarrhea day for NC, PC and CuSO,, and none for ZnO

and ZnO+CuSO, combination.

ZnO+CuSOg combination, respectively.

2Diarthea days = total number of days in the period with a diarrhea score 23.

There were no significant differences shown in the diarrhea frequency among the
dietary treatments (Table 8). Excluding pigs fed with ZnO at day 0 to 7, there were higher
diarrhea frequency observed from the other dietary treatments. There was a decrease in
frequency throughout the experiment from pigs fed with the PC diet. There was no diarrhea
frequency observed on day 8 to 14 and day 15 to 21 in pigs fed with the ZnO+CuSO,
combination.

Previous research showed that increased dietary zinc can decrease incidence of
diarrhea after weaning and dietary copper enhance growth rates both in weanling (Jacela
et al., 2010) and growing pigs (Shelton et al., 2009), although the mode of action by which
zinc and copper improves growth and reduce incidence of diarrhea is not entirely clear (Li
et al., 2006; de Mille et al., 2022). Mitigating decreases in intestinal integrity and
permeability, as well as modulating gut microbiota by reducing lactic acid and raising
coliform numbers, are some potential modes of action of zinc (de Mille et al., 2022) and

copper has been shown to have bacteriostatic property (Espinosa and Stein, 2021). High

31

doses of dietary ZnO have shown to support a large diversity of coliforms in weaned
piglets, to reduce the susceptibility of pigs to E. coli infection, and to reduce fecal counts
of lactobacilli and enterococci during the post-weaning period, but only temporarily. A
clear decrease in the total number of anaerobes and lactobacilli and an increase in the
number of coliforms in ileum samples from animals fed a ZnO diet was observed and the
use of CuSO, in weanling diets was reported to specifically reduce the number of

streptococci in fecal samples and lactobacilli (Hajberg et al., 2005).

2Subjective color scale (color): 1 = yellowish brown, 2 = brown, and 3 = black.

*<Values within a row not sharing a common symbol are significantly different (P<0.05).

Table 10 shows the CIE Lab values of the feces at day 0, 7, 14, and 21. As with the
subjective scores, L* and a* values of the feces of pigs fed with CuSO4 were lower
(P<0.001) compared to the other treatments at day 7, 14, and 21. The b* values of the feces
of pigs fed with CuSO4 were lower (P<0.001) compared to pigs fed the other diets at day
14 and 21. Overall, the L*, a*, and b* values of the feces of pigs fed with CuSO, were
lower (P<0.001) compared to the other treatments. Hill et al. (2000) and Coble et al. (2017)

were also able to observe the darkening (blackening) of fecal color when CuSO4 was added

33

to the diet. However, in ZnO+CuSO, combination diet, ZnO negated the dark (black) color
of the feces which was also observed by Debski (2016).

Subjective fecal color score was not correlated with diarrhea score and frequency
(Table 11). Likewise, subjective fecal color score was not correlated with a* value, but was
positively correlated (P<0.07) with the L* and b* values. Using the developed regression
model (Table 12), subjective fecal color score explained 72 and 79% of the variability in
L* and b* values of the feces, respectively. A feces color scale (for the objective fecal color
determination) (Figure 2) was then developed using the models for a color scale ranging

from a score of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0.

Study 2.
Effect of Supplemental Copper Source on Growth Performance, Diarrhea
Occurrence, Fecal Color, and Intestinal Health of Nursery Pigs in a Porcine
Epidemic Diarrhea-Infected Herd

Growth Performance

Throughout the experiment, there were no significant differences observed for all
the production parameters (ADG, ADFI, and F/G) measured across the treatments (Table
13). Pigs from this experiment were pigs that survived from litters that were positively
infected with PEDv and noticeably, post-weaning growth rates from d 0 to 14 were lower
than expected growth rates for healthy nursery pigs (0.45 kg/day; PHILSAN, 2012). As
observed in this trial period, the nursery pigs did not gain much weight and the animals fed
with NC even lost weight at d 8 to 14. However, pigs fed the PC, CuSO4, TBCC1, and
TBCC2 diets had growth rates approximately similar to the expected ADG during d 15 to
21. Overall (d 0 to 21), except for NC, pigs fed the PC, CuSO4, TBCC1, and TBCC2 diets
exceeded the expected ADG. The values for ADFI from d 0 to 21 were 42-52% lower
compared to the expected ADFI of 0.83 kg/day (PHILSAN, 2012). The result of the growth
performance in this study may be affected by the presence of PEDv in the farm as also
mentioned by Lee (2015). Alvarez et al. (2015) and Chen et al. (2021) reported that PEDv
decreases growth performance of weaned pigs. This statement was supported by the result
of Schweer et al. (2016) by comparing uninfected and infected pigs with PEDv and they
observed reduced ADG (0.66 vs. 0.35 vs. 0.20 kg/d; P < 0.01), ADFI (1.22 vs. 0.88 vs.

0.67 kg/d; P = 0.003), and G:F (0.54 vs. 0.39 vs. 0.31; P= 0.001).

Diarrhea Incidence

There were no significant differences in diarrhea score throughout the experiment
(Table 14). At d 8 to 14, it can be observed that there was an increase in the diarrhea score
regardless of the dietary treatments (Figure 3). Overall, mild diarrhea was observed among
the treatments, with pigs fed CuSO, having the highest value at 3.12 and TBCC2 with the

The results of the experiment showed that even with the PC diet which contained
antibiotics (tiamulin and chlortetracycline), diarrhea score, days, and frequency were not
controlled when the pigs were from litters previously infected with PEDv. Puls et al. (2019)
previously observed that less diarrhea occurred (P=0.08) when nursery pigs were fed diets
containing the tiamulin and chlortetracycline combination; however, their pigs were not
immunocompromised from a viral challenge.

In the present experiment, diarrhea score and mortality of the pigs were positively
correlated (r = 0.70, P=0.0037). It was observed that mortality was higher at d 8 to 14 of
the trial (Figure 4). The presence of PEDv, which is more severe in younger animals, causes
acute diarrhea and/or vomiting, dehydration, and high mortality (Curry et al., 2018; The

Pig Site, 2018; Jung et al., 2020; Gao et al.. 2021; Iowa State University, 2022).

Fecal Color

Pigs fed with diets containing supplemental copper have darker (grayer) in color
compared with the other diets (Table 17). Throughout the duration of the trial, feces of pigs
fed CuSO4, TBCC1, and TBCC2 diets had darker color (P<0.001) compared to the other
dietary treatments. Table 18 shows the CIE Lab values of the feces at day 7, 14, and 21. It
was observed that the L* and b* values of the feces of pigs fed with supplemental copper
regardless of the source were lower (P<0.001) compared to the other dietary treatments at
day 7, 14, and 21. The a* values of feces of pigs fed all the diets except for CuSO, and
TBCC2 had significant differences (P=0.007) at day 7. At day 14 and day 21, the CIE Lab
values of the feces fed with diets containing supplemental copper were different (P<0.001)
from the other diets. Overall, the CIE Lab values were lower (P<0.001) in copper
containing diets compared to the other diets. These results conformed with the findings of
the previous experiment that the darkening of the fecal color was observed from pigs fed
with diets containing pharmacological levels of copper. Hill et al. (2000) and Coble et al.
(2017) were also able to observe the darkening of fecal color (P<0.01) when high copper

was added compared to diets without copper.

Small Intestinal Morphology

No significant difference was observed in the small intestinal morphology of the
nursery pigs in all dietary treatments (Table 19). It can be observed that the duodenal crypt
depth of all dietary treatments was longer compared to the villus height, which shows that
villus-to-crypt ratio was almost 1:1 or less which normally ranges roughly from 3:1 to 5:1
ratio (Serra and Jani, 2006). Likewise, the jejunal and ileal crypt depth were longer
(P<0.05) than their villi in TBCC1. The ileal crypt depth of TBCC2 was longer compared
to its villi. A low villus:crypt ratio may indicate villus atrophy (Al Masri et al., 2015). Al
Masri et al. (2015) also reported that villus height, crypt depth, and villus:crypt ratio have
developmental changes in the young piglet and crypt depth along the length of the small
intestine increases with the age of the piglets. Although there was a natural occurrence of
decreasing villus:crypt ratio between 21 to 32 days of age, there was only approximately
50% decrease (ratios 8:1 to 4:1). This was still higher compared to the result of this study.
The decreased villus height:crypt depth ratio may be attributed to the PEDv which caused
villi atrophy (Pearce et al., 2016; Iowa State University, 2022), which means that the villi
were not developing properly. Degeneration or damage of villi which may reduce the
absorptive surface of fluids, may lead to diarrhea and dehydration (The Pig Site, 2018;
Iowa State University, 2022). This could possibly be the cause of the low growth

performance of the pigs.

Molecular Analysis

Conventional PCR was conducted to amplify target genes (Figure 5). The agarose
gel was able to verify that the correct target size of the gene was amplified and showed that
the primer pair used was effective. The identification results of the target gene and
housekeeping gene are shown in Table 20. It verified that the amplified PCR product was
the target gene. As shown in Figure 6, the amplified PCR product of IGF-1 was 67bp
located at 229-295 region of the template gene (NM_214256.1), occludin, a
transmembrane protein, amplified the membrane-associating domain, with 155bp PCR
product was located at 160-314 region (NM_001163647.2), and B-actin with 134bp was
located at 1066-1195 region (DQ845171.1).

As shown in Table 21, there were no significant differences in the gene expression
of IGF-1 (P=0.522) and occludin (P=0.611). The expression of the IGF-1 gene was
decreased by 2.38 folds in the PC diet, 2.30 folds in the CuSO, diet, 1.29 folds in TBCC1
diet, and 1.60 folds in TBCC2 diet. Similarly, the expression of occludin gene in CuSO4
also decreased by 3.44 folds. In contrast, the expression of the occludin gene in the other
dietary treatments increased. The gene expression of the PC increased by 1.21 folds, 2.83
folds in TBCC1, and 1.11 folds in TBCC2. Occludin, which is expressed in absorptive
enterocytes, were partially involved in binding and entry of PEDv into enterocytes (Jung
et al., 2020). This was also supported by the research of Luo et al. (2017), where oocludin
plays an essential role in PEDv entry process and it contributes to the infection as an entry

cofactor. Several tightly linked proteins (i.e. occludin, claudin, and junctional adhesion

48

molecule (JAM)) were validated to act as receptors for viruses (Mateo et al., 2015; Torres-
Flores and Arias, 2015). Moreover, viruses were found to invade the epithelium by binding
and destroying these tight-junction proteins (Hu et al., 2021). The PEDv upregulates the
expression level of the occludin, as can be observed in the result of the study. The observed
increased expression of occludin may be associated to this event. However, in the result of
Zong et al. (2019), the expression of occludin when infected with PEDv was significantly
lower (P<0.01) compared to normal pigs due to the destroyed intestinal barrier, and the
composition and function of tight junction was damaged. The tight junctional distribution
of occludin was prominently affected by PEDv infection and the susceptibility of target
cells to PEDv infection can be promoted or reduced by overexpression or downregulation
of occludin, respectively (Hu et al., 2021). IGF-1, an important mediator of the
proliferation and differentiation of enterocytes (Liu et al., 2018), may have a decrease in
gene expression due to the degeneration or damaged villi. Following the PEDv infection,
the short-term increase in apoptosis with insufficient increase or without the capacity to
increase proliferation resulted in blunted intestinal villi (Curry et al., 2017). In normal
healthy weanling pigs, inclusion of pharmacological levels of Cu in diets may also increase
villus height and reduce crypt depth (Zhao et al., 2007). The small intestine has the fastest
cell tumover in the body. By repeating the cycles of cell proliferation, migration, and
shedding, the epithelial cells of the small intestine are renewed every 3-5 days (Kai, 2021).
Under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions, IGF-1 acts as a trophic factor
in small intestine. Intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) specific IGF-1 promote the proliferation

and expansion of intestinal epithelial cells and promotes epithelial regeneration. Silencing

49

of IGF-I led to inhibition of intestinal cell proliferation. The loss of IEC-specific IGF-1
leads to shortened small intestine length and villus. and shallow crypts. implying an

irreplaceable paracrine/autocrine role of intestinal IGF-I in comparison with endocrine

1GK-1 (Zheng et al.. 2018).

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

Two studies were conducted to determine the effect of supplemental zinc and
copper source on growth performance, diarrhea occurrence, fecal color, and intestinal
health of nursery pigs.

In Study 1, the objectives were to determine the effect of supplemental Zn (ZnO)
and Cu (CuSO,), alone and in combination diarrhea incidence and fecal color and to
determine the correlation between diarrhea incidence and fecal color. The combination of
ZnO and CuSO, in the diet reduce the diarrhea incidence (P=0.021) of the nursery pigs. As
observed in the trial and other research, pigs fed with CuSO, diets had darker fecal color
(P<0.001) and with the addition of ZnO, the dark characteristic of the feces disappeared.
There was no relationship between fecal color and diarrhea score/frequency.

In Study 2, the objectives were to determine the effect of varying sources of copper
on the production parameters, diarrhea incidence, fecal color, and intestinal health of
nursery pigs in the presence of PEDv, to determine correlation between diarrhea incidence
and mortality, and to determine the gene expression levels of insulin-like growth factor 1
and tight junction protein occludin in intestinal development. Overall, there were no
significant differences (P=0.823, 0.404, and 0.697) diarrhea score, days, and frequency.
However, there was a 70% (P=0.004) correlation between diarrhea score and mortality.
Copper source did not affect the growth performance, small intestine morphology, and the
gene expressions of insulin-like growth factor 1 and occludin.

In conclusion, ZnO + CuSO, combination has an effect in diarrhea incidence caused

by post-weaning diarrhea. However, in the presence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus,

52

copper source or antibiotic was unable to reduce diarrhea incidence. Regardless of any

method to determine the fecal color, diets with purely copper source have darker color.

53

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the study, the author recommends to:

ib

The ZnO + CuSO, combination may be used to reduce diarrhea occurrence in nursery
pigs, however, additional studies should be conducted to observe the growth
performance of the animals.

Conduct the study in a disease-free farm and healthy animals to observe the effect of
the supplemented ZnO and different copper source.

The target and housekeeping genes to be used should not be affected by the health of
the animals or the target genes that may be used could be related to the effect of PEDv
to the animals to verify the result of growth performance. The tight junction proteins
that play an important role in maintaining the intestinal mucosal barrier and resisting
PEDv may be further investigated. At least three housekeeping genes should be used

for comparison to verify the accuracy of the result.
