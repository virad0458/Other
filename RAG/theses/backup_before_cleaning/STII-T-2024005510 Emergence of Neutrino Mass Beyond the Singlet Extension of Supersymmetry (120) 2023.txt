ABSTRACT

We have generated the tree-level Majorana neutrino masses from the
Triplet Extended Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (TMSSM) and
the Triplet Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (TNMSSM)
both in the presence of the bilinear R-parity violating interactions, μi​L̂i​Ĥu​
Neutrino mass expressions derived in TMSSM and TNMSSM are consistent
with the NMSSM and MSSM limits provided that μeff​≈μ. The mecha-
nisms that were found to suppress the neutrino mass are the cancellation
mechanism that depends on the mass parameters, and the compensation
mechanism which relies on the presence of mass and coupling parameters.
These mechanisms can explain the smallness of neutrino mass. A new ob-
servation was found in this study where TNMSSM pay a price of reducing
neutrino mass suppression mechanism in trying to solve the mu and the lit-
tle hierarchy problems. The results of this study can be used to constrain
SUSY parameters using neutrino mass, and vice versa, as data from both sides become available.

Introduction

1.1 Motivation

All of the information about the physics of the fundamental particles of the
universe, as well as their interactions, is dictated by a theoretical framework
called the Standard Model (SM), which serves as the basis for many of the
prevailing ideas, concepts, and observations about particle physics. One
of the open problems that cannot be solved by SM concerns the origin of
neutrino mass. [3-8].

The Higgs boson, the last particle found in the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC), is responsible for the masses of SM particles through the Higgs mech-
anism by spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking of U(1)y x SU(2)z
gauge group of the Standard Model. In other words, the gauge group sym-
metry of the Standard Model acts like a guideline that the SM particles and
forces must follow whenever they are involve in some specific process in parti-
cle physics and by breaking this symmetry, it allows us to generate the masses
of SM particles [6, 9-12]. The Yukawa couplings encode the interaction be-
tween the fundamental fermion and Higgs field, that is, it give us information
how much strength does a particle have in order to stick with the Higgs field.
These Yukawa couplings are typically of order ©(1) but for neutrinos, these

are of order < 107)? (3-5, 8]. As a result, the Higgs mechanism

is not responsible for the neutrino masses and the Standard Model treats
neutrinos as massless but it has been confirmed through experiments that
neutrinos have very small but posses a nonzero masses [1, 18-23]. Table 1.1
shows some of the experimental values of the sum of neutrino masses. From
this, we need a Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) mechanism to generate
the mass of neutrino.

Supersymmetry, one of the BSM theories, treats the fermion and boson
equally which implies that for every fermionic particle in the standard model,
there must be a corresponding bosonic supersymmetric or superpartner par-
ticle, and vice versa. Additionally, it further implies that there is also a }
difference in spin between the SM and superpartner particles. The spin of
particles is not interpreted as the rotating motion” we see in our everyday
lives but we use the term ”spin” to describe how particle behaves in space
quantum mechanically [3]. The simplest version of supersymmetry in which
the minimum number of particles is added while remaining theoretically con-
sistent is known as the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM)

[24-28].

The MSSM also faces challenges because it is unable to properly resolve
the hierarchy problem as the Higgs boson mass in the MSSM is predicted to
be lower than the Z boson mass. Another flaws of the MSSM deals with the
ps parameter because the phenomenology’s requirement for the scale of that
parameter is that it must be of the order of the electroweak scale but the
MSSM Lagrangian does not restrict the parameter near the Planck’s scale.
These scales describe an energy range by which particles are detected and
higher energy range correspond to a higher masses for particles [29, 30].

In order to address these issues the MSSM is extended by adding a new
field called the Higgs singlet superfield, §, [31, 32]. A superfield combines the
Standard Model and supersymmetric fields [27]. This new model is called the
Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM). This model
features an effective » which can naturaly coincide with the electroweak

symmetry breaking scale, alleviating the u problem. However, the NMSSM’s

3

1.2. Scope

Higgs boson mass suffers from suppression in the limit of large tan(@) where
6 is the separation parameter between the vacuum expectation values (vev)
of the two Higgs doublets. To put it simply, the Higgs boson from NMSSM
can still be suppressed or very small which is what we don’t want since Higgs
boson is responsible for generating the masses of SM particles (29, 30].

To resolve this problem, the Higgs triplet superfield, T, is introduced in
the model called the Triplet extended Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model (TMSSM) where a Higgs quartic coupling exists in this model. For-
tunately, the effect of the Higgs quartic coupling wouldn’t vanish in the limit
of large tan(3). This suggest that the Higgs mass wouldn’t be completely
suppressed in this limit. Nevertheless, TMSSM fails to solve the 4 problem
since it contains a y term in its own superpotential [29, 30].

The Higgs singlet and triplet superficlds are combined via the coupling A
in the model called the Triplet Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model (TNMSSM) to resolve the issue of the » parameter and the little
hierarchy problem (30, 33, 34]. The properties of vector and chiral superfields
are listed in the Table 1.2 and 1.3 [34].

1.2 Scope

This study aims to generate the tree-level mass of neutrino in the Triplet
Extended Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (TMSSM) and Triplet
Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (TNMSSM) which are
models beyond the singlet extension of supersymmetry. The other neutrino
mass eigenvalues can be determined using loop calculations and this is be-
yond the scope of this study. The work will also determine how the various
parameters of TMSSM and TNMSSM affect this mass, in particular, the
triplino and singlino mass parameters (M/7 and Mg) and the triplino- and
singlino-higgsino coupling parameters (A; and 4,).

The findings of the study will give insights about the origin of neutrino

1.2. Scope

mass, in particular, why they have such very small but nonzero values. This
study will benefit the particle physics community at large, specifically, col-
lider experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider since the results will also
give insight about the contraints of new parameters in the triplet extensions
of MSSM.

We want to clarify that the objectives of this study is to obtain the tree-
level neutrino mass in TMSSM and compare it with NMSSM. Noting that
TMSSM and NMSSM have problems on their own (y and the little hierarchy
problems), we work out the tree-level neutrino mass in TNMSSM and analyze
if the suppressing mechanism for this model will be enhanced or not as we
would expect that TMSSM and NMSSM provide a suppressing mechanism
of their own. The tree-level formulation is a good starting point since it
provides the mass to the most massive neutrino. While the tree-level alone
can’t generate masses for the other generation, this generation readily arises
once the loop effects are considered. However, the latter is beyond the scope
of our study.

This work is organized as follows: In Chapter 2, we will present a review
on the Standard Model (SM) as well as the Higgs mechanism that generates
the mass for SM particles and how this mechanism cannot be responsible for
the generation of neutrino masses. We will also tackle the concept of neutrino
oscillation, which requires neutrinos to be massive, further intensifying the
fact that neutrinos are not massless. The last part of Chapter 2 covers the so-
called see-saw mechanism, which is a non-SUSY extension of the Standard
Model and aims to address the issue of massless neutrinos in the SM. In
Chapter 3, we will discuss the overview of the formalism of supersymmetry
(SUSY) as well as the MSSM which is a model that contains the SM and
supersymmetric particles. We will also present the SUSY breaking which
has an important contribution to the generation of masses and finally, we
will introduce the R-parity violating (RPV) MSSM tree-level neutrino mass
obtained by [35]. In Chapter 4, we will explain the challenges of MSSM and

5

1.2. Scope

its extensions to solve all those problems. We will also discuss the RPV
NMSSM tree-level neutrino mass calculated by [31]. In Chapter 5, we will
present the main results of this work and lastly, Chapter 6 gives the summary
of results of this study as well as recommendations on how to improve this

work.

Chapter 2

Higgs Mechanism and the
Problem of Neutrino Mass

This chapter will discuss the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics as well
as the Higgs mechanism that generates the masses of SM particles. We will
also explain how the said mechanism cannot be responsible for the genera-
tion of neutrino masses. We will tackle the phenomenon called the neutrino
oscillation which requires neutrinos to have masses and lastly, we will discuss
the seesaw mechanism which is a non-SUSY extensions of Standard Model

to incorporate massive neutrinos.

2.1 The Standard Model

The physics of all of the universe’s fundamental particles is dictated by the
Standard Model (SM) [8, 36-39]. The two categories of particles are fermions
and bosons where the former have a half-integer values of spin and follow the
exclusion principle stated in Fermi-Dirac statistics. The latter are mediators
of the three forces of nature (electromagnetic, strong, and nuclear), and they
have whole-integer spin values. They are not constrained to occupy the same

state concurrently as they follow the Bose-Einstein statistics [3, 4].

2.1. The Standard Model

Leptons and quarks are the two families into which fermions are divided.
Leptons are elementary spin-} particles that are unaffected from the strong
force. The charged (electron (e), muon (j:), tau (7 )) and neutral (electron
neutrino (v.), muon neutrino (v,), tau neutrino (v,)) leptons are the two type
into which they fall. There is an anti-lepton for each lepton [3, 4, 6, 24, 25}.

Furthermore, the spin-} quarks are the basic units that make up the
proton and neutron which are not impervious to the strong force because
they possess a color charge (red(R), blue(B), and green(G)) on top of electric
charge by which each color has an anti-color for an anti-quark. These colors
are used as a representation of the internal degree freedom for the quark
model rather than being intended to be the ’color” that we use in our daily
lives. Both up-type (up (u), charm (c), top (t)) and down-type (down (d),
strange (s), bottom (b)) quarks can be classified under the category of quarks
(5, 7].

In view of the fact that unbounded or free quarks have never been directly
identified through experiments, quarks are now solely observed in groupings
known as hadrons. This occurrence is known as the color confinement

This phenomenon occurs because, according to the potential [3]
V(r) ~ «r (2.1)

The above equation tells us that an infinite amount of energy would be
required to separate two quarks due to the x. The two forms of hadrons are
the baryons and mesons. The former contain at least three quarks (e.g.
proton (p+ - uud), neutron (n° - udd), Lambda (A° - uds), Sigma (=> -
dds, =° - uds, E+ - uus), etc.) whereas the latter contain a quark and an

antiquark pair (pion (1* - ud), kaon (K* - u3), p (p* - ud), etc.) [8, 36, 37].

Apart from that, fermions are categorized in Table 2.1 by generation. Ev-
ery individual belonging to a higher generation possesses higher mass com-
pared to an individual from a lower generation, but, all particles in all three
generations share the same other attributes. As of this point, it is unknown
where this mass hierarchy came from. The reason why particles from higher
generations decay into particles from earlier generations can be explained by
their relative masses. [2].

As previously laid out, gauge bosons are the other class of particles in the
Standard Model. These gauge bosons are like a group of delivery crew that
pass messages where these messages are the four fundamental forces of nature
[3, 4]. The photon (y), W+, Z°, and the gluon (g) are all spin-1 gauge bosons
in SM. In a microscopic setting, the exchange of force carriers facilitates
interaction among particles, and we can view this as forces acting on particles
in a macroscopic world, more specifically photons for the electromagnetic
force, W and Z bosons for the weak nuclear force, in charge of radioactive
processes like beta decay, and gluons for the strong nuclear force that binds
quarks to protons and neutrons inside the nucleus [3, 4, 24, 25].

The Higgs boson is the final piece needed to complete the Standard Model,
which is responsible for the masses of SM particles except for neutrinos gener-
ated via the Higgs mechanism by means of breaking the electroweak symme-
try. In-depth discussions of the said mechanism will be covered in the next
section. Figure 2.2 showcases every particle of the Standard Model along

with each one’s unique and distinctive characteristics. The SM’s mathemati-

cal structure falls within the U(1)y ® SU(2), ® SU(3)c group, and it must
be required to be invariant by the aforementioned group symmetry. To put it
simply, all equations within that describe specific processes and interactions
in SM should not change when we perform a particular transformation within
the U(1)y ® SU(2), ® SU(3)c gauge group symmetry [3].

The Standard Model is regarded as one of the most successful theories
governing the fundamental particles where its predictions agree with collider

experiments listed below [8, 39]:

e The findings of the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider ete~ re-
garding the measurement of the mass of and couplings of the Z boson
are compatible with SM’s prediction which further providing a test
for Glashow-Salam-Weinberg (GSW) model of electroweak unification
[3, 40].

e The assumption of the Standard Model that fermions are grouped into

three generations is experimentally verified using the properties of the

10

2.1. The Standard Model

Z boson [3, 40].

e Measurements on how frequently the Z boson decomposed into pairs
of electrons, muons and tau leptons performed at the LEP provided an
experimental evidence of the SM’s presumption that distinct leptons
from three generations of fermions have the same electroweak coupling
also known as the lepton universality but the result is valid with respect
to the energy range at which the collider is operated between the mass
of Z boson up to 209 GeV [40].

e Examining the correlation between the width of the Z boson production
cross section to the number of different possible final Z decay states
at the LEP also confirmed the other assumptions of SM that there are

three generations of leptons [40].

e Verification of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) from quark, gluon

and color charge experimental observations [41].

e The experimental identification of the top quark. which has a mass of

around 170 GeV and is thought to be the heaviest quark [42]

e The experimental findings for the electron magnetic dipole moment
within one part in one hunderd billion is in extremely good agreement
with SM’s prediction [43].

e The ATLAS and CMS in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) both an-
nounced last July 4, 2012 their experimental findings about a particle
with an approximate mass of 125 GeV which confirmed the existence

of the Higgs boson{9, 10].

We can agree that the great triumph of the Standard Model comes from
the fact that its theoretical prediction matches with experiments and mea-

surements but despite all of these, SM also has shortcomings because it fails

11

2.2. Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking

to account the open problems that we have today including the hierarchy
problem, dark matter and dark energy, gravity, neutrino mass, etc. This
is the main reason why Standard Model is considered to be an incomplete

theory. In this work, we will focus more on the problem of neutrino mass.

2.2 Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking

The following concepts, ideas and calculations presented in this section as well
as the discussions of Higgs mechanism closely follow the explanations from
[3, 11, 12, 44]. According to the Standard Model, the masses of particles are
generated by their interactions with the Higgs field. In order to understand
this phenomena, Ict us first discuss how a mass term from a Lagrangian can
arise by spontaneously breaking a symmetry.

The Higgs mechanism utilizes the spontaneous symmetry breaking to
generate the masses of SM particles. Now, to better understand this kind of
symmetry breaking let us consider the Lagrangian for scalar field, ¢, given
by I 1 1 1

= 5(0,6)(0"6) + 508? — 6" (2.2)

where yz and X are constants which are taken to be real. It is important to
emphasize that the above equation has a reflection or parity symmetry where
-£(¢) = L(-¢). In other words, the Lagrangian is still the same when we
flip it or mirror it hence the term ”reflection”. Even though the second term
of (2.2) looks like the mass term for scalar field but this is not conceivable
because the sign is positve rather than negative. Then, it appears that the
scalar field is massless but we want the field to be massive. How are we
going to generate the mass for ¢? In order to achieve this, let us identify
the ground state of the system. Recall that the Lagrangian in terms of the
kinetic and potential is given by [7]

L=T-V (2.3)

12

2.2. Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking

where T and V are the kinetic and potential term, respectively. From (2.2),
it follows that [7]

= Loge lang Lone loge
V= (5% 70") =-3H8? + 70 (2.4)

The ground state correspond to a field configuration where V(¢) is minimum
where the system here is in a most stable state. To better understand this,
let us imagine we have some object in hemispherical of half-sphere bowl. We
can agree that when we roll down that object into the bowl, it attains its
most stable state in the bottom part of the bowl. Then, the object attains
its ground state will depend on the shape of the bowl wherein this shape
corresponds to the potential [7]. In this case, ve) = 0. From this the

minimum happens when [7]

0=-p'o+r¢°
>¢= +5 (2.5)

By minimizing the potential we obtain two minimum values for the scalar
field as shown from Figure 2.3. Next, we construct a new field variable, 7,

based on the change of ¢ with respect to the minima [7]
n=ot (2.6)

where 77 is the deviation from the minimum. Substituting (2.6) to (2.2), we
obtain [7] ;

From (2.7) we can now read off the mass since the second term now

corresponds to the mass term [7],

5m - per?
>m= V2 (2.8)

The third and fourth terms on (2.7) correspond to self-interactions of 7
with pA and x as couplings to these interactions. We may safely ignore
the constant in the final term because it has no significance. We recognize
that (2.7) is not symmetric with 7 since the new Lagrangian has a cubic
component, that is [7],

Ln) # L(-n) (2.9)

To put it another way, the moment we identify a certain ground state
and re-express the original Lagrangian from this state, what happens is that
the symmetry of the original Lagrangian becomes impeded. This is a nice
illustration of how spontaneous symmetry breaking works since we didn’t
rely to any external factor to break the symmetry [7]. We can also show the
difference between massless and massive scalar fields in terms of a graph of
total energy, FE, as a function of kinetic energy, T, as shown by Figure 2.4

where the plot of massless scalar field is a straight line passing through the

energy (EF = m = 1 GeV) where the kinetic energy is zero.

What if we had a complex one? Up until now, we only utilized sponta-
neous symmetry breaking on a single real scalar field. To do this, let us the

Lagrangian for a complex scalar field given by [3]
L = (8,0)* (9) — u°(¢"d) — A(9"4)? (2.10)

Note that (2.10) is invariant under the global U(1) symmetry, ¢ > e'%¢.

Now since ¢ is complex, that is, ¢ = yal + id2), we can express (2.10) as

where v is the vacuum state that corresponds to the dotted circular line as
shown on Figure 2.5 b.). Here, we have a question? What is the difference
between the ground state and the vacuum state? We have explained earlier
that the ground state of the system is the most stable state that a particle
can attain which corresponds to the lowest energy state. Now if we remove
the particle, the lowest energy state of the system now becomes the vacuum
state [7].

Figure 2.5 b.) shows that the global U(1) symmetry has been sponta-
neously broken. Also, the coordinate fields can be expressed as ($1, ¢2) =
(v,0) if the vacuum state, v, is chosen to be in the real direction. With

this, we may add additional fields. With this, we can expand the fields with

16

2.3. Higgs Mechanism: Masses of Fermions, Gauge Bosons and
the Higgs Boson

respect to the vacuum state by introducing a new fields given by [3]

bi(z) = (2) +0 (2.14)
a(t) = ¢(z) (2.15)

ll

From (2.14) and (2.15), the complex scalar field is ¢ = a(n +u+ iC).
Substituting this to (2.10), we have [3]

= 5(0,n)(On) — 5mPn? + 3 (8,60) —Voulm.6) (218)

where m, = V2Av?. As a result, when we think a complex scalar field with
two component fields, one of them gets a mass while the other one becomes
massless. The particle that this massless field describes is known as the

Goldstone boson.

2.3. Higgs Mechanism: Masses of Fermions,
Gauge Bosons and the Higgs Boson

We have seen that the spontaneous symmetry breaking can generate the mass
for real scalar field. In the case of complex scalar field, the one component
field becomes massive while the other field is massless corresponding to a
Goldstone boson. In this section we will demonstrate the application of
spontaneous symmetry breaking in Higgs mechanism to generate the masses

for fermions, gauge bosons as well as the Higgs boson.

2.3.1 Masses of Higgs and Gauge Bosons

The Higgs mass can be generated by spontaneously breaking the symmetry

of the Higgs potential [3]
V(¢) = 19? + 9" (2.17)

which is the global U(1) symmetry. A system respects this symmetry when

it is unchanged under the associated transformation which is related to the

17

2.3. Higgs Mechanism: Masses of Fermions, Gauge Bosons and
the Higgs Boson

electric charge of the system. The U(1) local gauge invariant Lagrangian is
[3]

L = (Dy o)"(D"o) — V(¢) (2.18)
where D, is the gauge covariant derivative, D, = 0, + igB,. B, is the
new gauge field in the covariant derivative. The gauge invariant Lagrangian,
Leauge, that describes the new gauge field is just —}F“”F,, where F*” Fy,
corresponds to the kinetic term and F#” is the Maxwell’s stress-energy tensor.

The full Lagrangian is given by [3]

L= Leauge + (D,)*(D"6) _ Vitiges()
1
& = —7F Fu + (Dyu6)"(D"8) — Viiges(4)
= —TP By — 2d — D0"
— igB,¢*(0"$) + ig(0,6")B“¢ + 9B, B' "od (2.19)

Analogous to what we saw in the preceding section, the complex scalar field

can be expanded around the nonzero vev, v, given by [3]
62) = Felv+n(a) + ic(2) (2.20)
Now, substituting (2.20) to (2.19), we have [3]

L= 5 (84n)(0"n) — dv*7? + 5 (046)(2%6) - 7 Pe Fy + 5070? B, Be
— Vin. + gv B, (OC) (2.21)

We obtain a massive 7-field and gauge B,-field with a massless ¢ Goldstone
ficld after performing spontancous symmetry breaking as we can see from
(2.21) where we have to eliminate the Goldstone boson to have a consistent
number of degrees of freedom. A degree of freedom describes the intrinsic
properties (such as the polarization) of particle and how they move in space.
For example, an object can move up, down, right, left, forward and backward.

Then, we can say that object has 6 degrees of freedom. We also take note

18

2.3. Higgs Mechanism: Masses of Fermions, Gauge Bosons and
the Higgs Boson

that the degrees of freedon can describe the state of an object. In terms of a
field, it can be polarized in some particular direction or orientation depending
upon the system. In other words, polarization describes the state of the field
that is why polarization is part of the degrees of freedom characterizing the
state of the field [36, 37]. With this the Lagrangian from (2.21) can be

expressed as [3]
1 i 2,2 1 py 1 2,.2 py’ pl
L= 9 (Fun) (8 7) — Av*n? — ar Fuy + 99° BY By — Vint (2.22)

We can notice from (2.22) that the massless Goldstone field, ¢, disappeared
from the Lagrangian. This is because when the gauge field, B,,, acquires mass
through spontaneous symmetry breaking, the degree of freedom of ¢ becomes
absorbed to B, giving the gauge field an additional degree of freedom [3. 7].
The literature often refers to this disapperance as the Goldstone boson being
“eaten by the gauge field” {3-5, 7, 8, 36-38]. This happens when we choose
a particular gauge to represent the system in which in this case, we have
chosen a the unitary gauge. This unitary gauge is somehow a kind of choice
to simplify certain calculations where in this case, to fix the inconsistencies
between the number of degrees of freedom [3]. Then, we can now express the
field, ¢, as [3]

(2) = Ze(v+ nl2)

$(2) = ae + h(2)) (2.28)

where h(z) is the Higgs field. The Lagrangian from (2.19) in terms of the
Higgs field with uy? = —Av? is given by [3]

L= 5 (8uk) (OR) — dv?h? — ne - Fw FH + 500 B, BY
g’vB,BYh+ 50° B,B"h + 50° B, Ben — Avh3 — aha (2.24)
where the first and second terms describe the massive higgs field given by [3]
mu = V2Xv (2.25)

2.3. Higgs Mechanism: Masses of Fermions, Gauge Bosons and
the Higgs Boson

where v is the Higgs vev equal to 246 GeV. The massive gauge boson is repre-
sented by the third and fourth terms. The fifth and sixth terms describe how
the Higgs interacts with the gauge bosons, while the Higgs self-interaction
can be found on the last two parts of (2.25).

In order to generate the mass of the other gauge bosons (W+, Z°), we
need to spontaneously break the U(1)y x SU(2), local gauge symmetry which
pertains to the combination of U(1)y and SU(2), gauge symmetries govern-
ing the interactions involving electromagnetic and weak forces, respectively.
The first step of Higgs mechanism is to introduce the Higgs field which is
usually representated by a column vector (weak isopsin doublet) to account
for its two components, the charged and neutral Higgs. To better understand
the concept of the weak isopin doublet let say for example we have a pair
of left and right socks. Obviously, these two socks have different properties
but we need the two socks as they exists in pair because they are linked with
one another. This similar to the weak isopin doublet where it is composed
of two particles which has different properties but they are linked together
as they shared the common characteristics which is the weak isospin. The
weak isospin is a property of a particle related to the weak interactions [3

Ae f 2

o= ( 7%) (2.26)

After introducing the Higgs field we need to perform spontaneous symmetry

breaking. To do this, we need the Lagrangian for a doublet [3]

L = (8,9)! (0"9) — Vitiges(#) (2.27)
where the Higgs potential, Vitiggs(¢), is given by [3]

Vitiegs(¢) = 1 o'd + X(4'9)? (2.28)

2.3. Higgs Mechanism: Masses of Fermions, Gauge Bosons and

The nonzero minima of the Higgs potential is generated when p? < 0 as we

can observe from our previous discussion [3],

We choose the vev to be on ¢° only so that the U(1)y symmetry is unbroken

which tells us that photon is still massless. Then the vev can be written as

[3]

(0|¢|0) = Va (°) (2.30)

Choosing an appropriate gauge to eliminate these Goldstone fields, the com-

plex scalar field can be expressed as [3]

o(z) = s (, ee), (2.31)

We see that the Higgs acquire a nonzero vev. Then in order for gauge bosons
to acquire masscs, they need to interact (or mix) with the Higgs field, specif-
ically, the charged (W*) and neutral gauge boson (Z°) will mix with the
neutral and charged components of Higgs, respectively. In order to do this
the covariant derivatives must be reformulated in the local gauge symmetry
of U(1)y x SU(2), group. The resulting Golstone bosons will be absorbed in
the degrees of freedom of Standard Model gauge bosons (W“), W@), W®))
through the Higgs mechanism giving us the mass [3]

2.3.2 Masses of Fermions and the Neutrino Mass Prob-
lem

In a similar manner to that of gauge bosons, the masses of fermions can also
be generated through the Higgs mechanism via spontaneously breaking the

U(1)y x SU(2)z local gauge symmetry starting from the Lagrangian [3]
— Lyutawa,lep = Y;,L1,¢Er, + hic. (2.36)

where Yj} are the Yukawa couplings which describe the interaction of Higgs
to fermions, the Lu, and Ep, are an SU (2), doublet left-handed and singlet
right-handed components of fermions, respectively. We must emphasize that
the left- and right-handedness of particles are not directly related to the
physical left- and right-handed of particles but rather, it is directly related
to the direction of the spin of particles such that if a particle is spinning in
a clockwise direction, they are right-handed. If the spin is counterclockwise,
then, they are left-handed [3]. It is important to remember that our natural
way of thinking when it comes to masses of fermions is to consider the mass

term from the Dirac Lagrangian given by [3]
— mypy = —m(wrdr + VLR) (2.37)

22

2.4. The Neutrino Oscillation and Seesaw Mechanism

But (2.37) does not respect the U(1)y x SU(2), local gauge symmetry and
(2.36) fix this problem. After performing spontaneous symmetry breaking,
the masses for charged leptons are given by [3]
t_yil
my; _ Lear

The Yukawa couplings for fermions are of order ©(1) almost exactly unity

(2.38)

but however, the Yukawa couplings for neutrinos are < 10°}%. This tells
us that Higgs mechanism is not responsible for neutrino masses and in fact,
right-handed neutrinos are not present in SM. This tells us that the tree-
level neutrino masses are zero. Furthermore, the neutrino mass cannot be
generated at the loop level because the lepton number conservation will be
violated. This is the reason why in the Standard Model, neutrinos are treated
to be massless [1, 3-5, 7, 8, 36-38. 45, 46]. However, as you will see in the
next section, experiments from neutrino oscillation revealed that neutrinos
are not actually massless, but, they have very small and nonzero masses. This
makes the prediction of the Standard Model contradictory to the true nature
of neutrinos. This is the neutrino mass problem of SM which is considered

to be an open problem in particle physics up to this day of writing.

2.4 The Neutrino Oscillation and Seesaw Mech-
anism

We have seen how the neutrino mass problem arises in the Standard Model,
in which neutrinos are assumed to be massless. In this section, we will discuss
the phenomenon of neutrino oscillation, where, in order for this process to
work, neutrinos must have masses. We will also examine the see-saw mecha-
nism that provides an explanation for why neutrinos have very small masses.

The content of this section follows closely from the discussions of [1, 3].

23

2.4. The Neutrino Oscillation and Seesaw Mechanism

2.4.1 Neutrino Oscillation and its Experimental Veri-
fications

The neutrino oscillation is a phenomenon in which the neutrino changes its
flavor (electron neutrino (v--), muon neutrino (v,-), tau neutrino (v,-)) as it
travels along the space with a specific distance, LE [1, 3-5, 7, 8, 36-38, 45, 46].
Now, let us demonstrate mathematically how particle physics predicted the
existence of this process by imagining a neutrino in some initial state. This
state can be written in terms of flavor eigenstate representations, |ve), |v,),
and |v,). In fact, there are two specific states that describe a particle which
are the flavor and mass eigenstates. These flavors describe the same type pf
particle but with different mass. Say for example, neutrino has three flavors,
we have the electron neutrino, muon neutrino and tau neutrino. These are
all flavors of neutrino but they have different masses [4, 5, 7]. Recall that
in quantum mechanics, the state of particle can be expressed in terms of a
linear superposition of all its possible or basis states because the states of
a quantum-mechanical particle can be linearly added and the sum of these
states also constitute a state [7]. Then, if we assume that neutrinos have

three mass eigenstates (|), |v2), |v3)), we can express the states as [3]

[Ye) = US, |r) + US |v2) + Uss |v3) (2.39)
Uz) = Ups |r) + Ute |Y2) + Usa |v) (2.40)
|vp) = UN, |r) + UF |v2) + UF |v) (2.41)

We can write these states in a more compact expression as [1]

Yo) = > Uy |) (2.42)

where U,; is an element of unitary matrix called the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-

Sakata or PMNS matrix which contains information about the mixture of the

Assume that the state of neutrino evolves in time, t, after it covers a distance,
L, [1]

\Va(t) - Sou: 1 \vi(t) (2.44)

Next, we determine the probability of a neutrino changing its flavor, |v,(t)),

into another flavor, |vg). This is given by [1]

Pag = | (Yalva(t))
Pap = (2 10) (su: VAG) )
Pap =|) 90 Ua, (vslea(t)) (2.45)

Assuming that the state of neutrino can be described by a plane wave, then,

we can express the following expression as [1]:

Let us extract the physics of (2.51). If the mass squared difference, Am?., and

the case where a # . Thus, if neutrino oscillation really happens in nature
to happen, we must have a non-vanishing squared mass difference and mixing
matrix, Am}, # 0 and U,,U,; # 0. These indicates that neutrinos are not
massless and their flavor and mass eigenstates are mix. If neutrino oscillation
really exists, this will also tells us that neutrinos does not respect the lepton
flavor conservation [1, 3, 6, 26].

Now, we have a question. Does neutrino oscillation really happen in
nature? The answer is YES. We have a number of experiments confirming
the existence of neutrino oscillation [47-53]. Table 1.1 also shows some of the
measurements of the upper bounds of neutrino masses [1, 13-23]. Therefore,
it is experimentally verified that neutrinos are not massless as SM predicted
but rather, neutrinos have non-zero and very small masses. The challenge
now is to explain why masses of neutrinos are suppressed, that is, so much
smaller compared to the masses of quarks and other leptons. One proposed

explanation for this is the so-called seesaw mechanism.

27

2.4. The Neutrino Oscillation and Seesaw Mechanism

2.4.2 The Seesaw Mechanism: A Non-SUSY Exten-
sion of SM

We have seen earlier that the Dirac mass term, —myw = —mp(Wrvr +
Ptr), is not invariant under the U(1)y x SU(2)z local gauge symmetry
due to the fact that this term mixes the left- and right-handed fermions
which have their own different gauge transformations (3-5, 7, 8, 36-38, 45,
16]. Nevertheless, when it comes to neutrino, the Dirac mass term can still
serves as a basis if we assume that a left-handed neutrino, vz, and a right-
handed antineutrino, vp, exist. These are called Dirac neutrinos which forms

a doublet given by the matrix [4]

Up = (%) (2.52)

The properties of components of Dirac neutrino can be very different to each

other. The Lagrangian governing the Dirac neutrinos is given by [3, 4]

Lp = —Mp(VivR + VRvz)
1
Lp = —5mplivr + Davi, + Davy + VRV{)
1
Lp = —5Mv(¥LYR + DR) + he. (2.53)

The other class of neutrinos are called the Majorana neutrinos in which there
is no distinction about its components. In other words, a Majorana neutrino

is identical to its antineutrino. This is represented by [4]
Um = v5 (2.54)

The Majorana Lagrangian can be expressed as [3]

1
Ly = 5M Pave + DrVp) (2.55)
We can combine the contribution of the Dirac and Majorana Lagrangian
given by [3]
1
LZ = -3 (mpiLVR + MpVR + M(VAvR + DRVR) + hic. (2.56)

Just like what we have discussed in the previous sections, the physical mass
will come from solving the eigenvalues of the specific mass matrix, then, let

us solve the eigenvalues [3],

2.4. The Neutrino Oscillation and Seesaw Mechanism

We can observe that (2.60) is very small since the Majorana mass, M, is
relatively large compared to the Dirac mass, mp. The assumption that
AM > mp is the core of seesaw mechanism which explains why the masses
of neutrinos we observe in experiments (by which in this case it correspond
to |m_|), are very small. From (2.60), we can see that neutrino masses will
fall in the range of eV if mp ~ ©(1 GeV) and M ~ 10!1 GeV [3-5, 7].
Perhaps, one can think that this mechanism can be experimentally verified
by detecting these massive neutrinos of order we have stated earlier.

The seesaw mechanism we have just discussed is an example of a type I
seesaw mechanism which introduces a massive right-handed neutrinos. The
other types of seesaw mechanisms are type II and type III, which both extend
the Standard Model by adding Higgs and fermion triplets, respectively. These
new particles can interact with the SM left-handed neutrinos and charged
leptons [54-56].

In this work, we will generate the neutrino mass within the context of
supersymmetry, a Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) theory which we

will now discuss in the next section.

Chapter 3

Supersymmetry and The
Tree-Level Majorana Neutrino
Mass in MSSM

In this chapter, we will discuss the basic ideas of supersymmetry as well
as how to construct supersymmetric Lagrangians which is a crucial part of
formulating a theory within the framework of SUSY. We will also tackle
how to break the supersymmetry to generate the masses of SUSY and SM
particles. In addition, we will also tackle the basic model of SUSY called
the MSSM and in the last part, we will explain the neutrino mass from R-
parity violating MSSM obtained by [35] since their results are a key part of

understanding the results of this work.

3.1 Supersymmetry

As of this writing, there are many unsolved problems within the Standard
Model which is a primary reason why SM is considered to be an incomplete
theory [3-8, 36-38]. To address these concerns, one of the proposed solutions
is to go beyond the current understanding that the Standard Model can give
us about the governing physics of fundamental particles and their interaction.

Supersymmetry, also known as SUSY, targets these issues by im

posing an additional symmetry (the supersymmetry) between the fermions
and bosons thereby extending the particle content of SM to include super-
symmetric particles or superpartners of every SM particles [24-28]. These
can be seen on Figure 3.1 where the superpartners for spin-} fermions are
called spin-0 (s)fermions (selectron (@ ), smuon (ji), stau (7), squarks (4),
etc.). For spin-1 gauge bosons, we have spin-} gaug(ino)s (e.g. photino (4),
wino (W*), zino (Z°), gluino (g)). Lastly, we also have spin-} higgsino for
spin-0 Higgs boson [25]. Now, in order for us to understand how SUSY
works, let us discuss the Wess-Zumino model which is the simplest model in

supersymmetry.

3.2 Constructing Supersymmetric Lagrangian:
Wess-Zumino Model and the Superpoten-
tial

The Wess-Zumino model is crucial in understanding supersymmetry because

it gives us a nice introduction of the superfields as well as the superpotentials

32

3.2. Constructing Supersymmetric Lagrangian: Wess-Zumino
Model and the Superpotential

which are a key part of constructing Lagrangians that are invariant under
supersymmetry [25, 27]. The discussion in this section as well as in the next
section are adapted from [25].

In this model, we have a single set of complex scalar field, ¢, left-chiral
Wey] spinor, x, an auxiliary field, F, a SUSY parameter, €, and an infinites-
imal parameter, ¢, which is a Weyl spinor. These Weyl spinors are used
to describe fermions which are consists of two-components having different
properties. A Weyl spinor can be obtained from the Wey] equation [7]. A
complex scalar field describes a spin-0 field corresponding to a complex scalar
particle when that field undergoes quantization. A left-chiral Weyl spinor is
a two-component irreducible representation of the Dirac spinor which de-
scribe a spin-} fermions. If we recall the Dirac equation, which describe the

dynamics of a spin-} fermions, in natural units given by [3]
(i — m)V =0 (3.1)

where # = 70, m is the mass of particle, and W is a four-component Dirac

spinor given by [3]
aN

The Dirac spinor can be expressed in terms of two components [25]

v= (7") (3.3)

where np and yz, are the right- and left-chiral Wey] spinors. Using (3.3), we

can express (3.1) as [3]
i5"@,nr = 0 (3.4)
io*OuxL = 0 (3.5)

where o” are the Pauli spin matrices. (3.4) and (3.5) are called the Weyl

equations. On the other hand, the auxiliary field, F', doesn’t correspond

33

3.2. Constructing Supersymmetric Lagrangian: Wess-Zumino
Model and the Superpotential

to any physical particle since it is a purely mathematical artifact needed
to make the number of degrees of freedom consistent between bosons and
fermions under supersymmetric transformation [24, 25, 27, 28]. The ¢ is an
infinitesimal parameter corresponding to the SUSY transformations of ¢, x,

and F given by [25]

56 =€-x = 7 (-t0”)x
5d' = x-C = xhio?¢*

bx = —io"(O,0)io?6* + FC
6F = -i¢ta"d,x

We will not discuss the derivation of (3.6)-(3.9) since it has a little importance
in our discussion. Now, our goal in this section is to construct the Lagrangian
for this model which must be renormalizable, that is, the physical observables
we can extract from this theory can be express in a finite expression that
correspond to the measurement we obtained from experiments [3]. Next, it
must also be real and Lorentz-invariant, that is, if a term in the Lagrangian
has an upper contravariant Lorentz index then it must be contracted with
a lower covariant Lorentz index [3]. A nice example of a Lorentz-invariant
quantity is the invariant mass, m, where it is calculated as an inner dot
product of a four-vector momentum, p”, where p” contains the temporal and
spatial components of a four-vector momentum, p“ = (E,p*, p’,p*). Then,
the invariant mass is m = p“p, = E?—p?, and with this, when one calculates
the invariant mass of a system, this doesn’t change no matter what frame
of reference we used since the aforementioned physical quantity is expressed
in terms of a contraction of a four-vector [37]. Lastly, it must be invariant
under the SUSY transformation that we mentioned earlier [25].
The free Lagrangian which contains no interaction between the fields is

3.2. Constructing Supersymmetric Lagrangian: Wess-Zumino
Model and the Superpotential

We can construct a Lagrangian that satisfies the three criteria which includes

interaction of ¢ and ¢! given by [25]

4 = G(¢,9") (3.11)

provided that the function G is real, Gt = G. We can also build a Lagrangian
from the interaction W,(¢, ¢!)F given by [25]

LA =W,F+Wwirt (3.12)

We can also construct a Lagrangian from the interaction —4W,1(, ')x - x
given by [25]

Ly= Wax x- sWhx x (3.13)

Adding up all the Lagrangians we have constructed [25],

1 1 - -

where [25]
Ln =L.+ B+ (3.15)

All of the Lagrangians we have built satisfy all the three criteria except for
the SUSY transformations. Now, it will take some effort to obtain conditions
which will make the Lagrangian SUSY-invariant, nevertheless the Lagrangian
is given by [25] w Me

Bn = ag F — a HgeX Xt he. (3.16)
where W = img? + dyd* + Co + f(¢") is called the superpotential. We
shall understand better why it is called superpotential when we discuss the

superfields since from its expression, it is not clear why it is called that way.

We will derive (3.21) using a more straightforward way of constructing a

SUSY-invariant Lagrangian known as the superspace formalism.

3.3. The Superspace Formalism: Reproduc-
ing the Wess-Zumino Lagrangian

Let us consider a field #(x). If one wants to translate this field in four-
dimensional spacetime, we can use the sandwich method” in order to do
this, that is [25],

9(z') = U(a)o(x)U'(a) (3.22)
where ¢(x’) is the translated field, U(a) = exp(ia"P,) is the correspond-
ing unitary operator for the spacetime translational transformation, a” is
the displacement vector, and P, is the charges or the generator of transla-
tional symmetry [24, 25, 27, 28]. These charges produce the translation of
the fields. Now, let us ask the question: what is the counterpart of a uni-
tary operator corresponding to translational symmetry in the framework of

supersymmetry?

36

3.3. The Superspace Formalism: Reproducing the Wess-Zumino
Lagrangian

The corresponding unitary operator in SUSY is [25]
Uc = exp(iQ-¢+iQ-C) (3.23)

where Q is known as the supercharge which is a generator of supersymmetry
and ¢ is called the Grassman variables which is a Weyl spinor. We want
to treat these Grassman quantities as our displacement vectors. Then, we
must extend the spacetime dependence of the fields to include a dependence
on four Grassman coordinates, ¢(z) > (zx, 6,6), since the SUSY unitary
operator contains ¢ and ¢ [25]. The extended spacetime is called the su-
perspace [24, 25, 27, 28]. It is termed the ’superspace” since this contains
the 4D-space physical dimensions and additional four SUSY dimensions [25].
We should emphasize that superspace is not the conventional physical space
that we know, but rather, a mathematical trick to simplify the formulation
of supersymmetric theories does not constitute a physical space, it is purely

a mathematical artifact as a trick to simplify the construction of supersym-

metric theories [24, 25, 27, 28]. The dots are defined to be [25]
Q-¢ = Q(-io’)¢ (3.24)
Q-6 = Qhio?¢” (3.25)

Then, the translation looks like [25]
B(x’, 6,6’) = U(a,¢, C) ®(x, 6, )U'(a,¢,¢) (3.26)

where (x,0,0) refers to the superficld which is a function of superspace

where z is the spacetime coordinate, 6 and 6 are the Grassman coordinates

defined to be [25]
= {%
6= (¢) (3.27)

6= (5:) (3.28)

3.3. The Superspace Formalism: Reproducing the Wess-Zumino
Lagrangian

where 9! = (6!)t and 6 = (6?)t [25].

Let us explain what is a Grassman coordinate or quantity since this is
new to us. We are familiar with the ordinary numbers we always encounter
in our everyday lives. We can agree that there is a rule on how to perform
mathematical operations with them like subtraction, addition, multiplica-
tion, division, etc. For higher level, we have differentiation, integration,
etc. Now, when we deal with Grassman numbers, there is an entirely dif-
ferent rule when we perform mathematical operations with them and this
feature of Grassman numbers is helpful in dealing with antisymmetric quan-
tities since in supersymmetry, we deal with anticommuting quantities, that
is, quantities that are not commuting (AB # BA) but rather they anticom-
mute (AB = —BA) [24]. Now, consider a superfield F(x, 61,92) where x
and 6,, 2 are the spacetime and Grassman coordinates by which in total, it
has 8 coordinates. Performing Taylor series expansion with respect to Grass-
man variables and applying the properties of a Grassman quantities (e.g.,
6? = 0), the result is [25]

where A(z) and D(z) are ordinary commutable functions while B(x) and
C(z) are Grassman functions. In terms of the scalar field, $(x), left-chiral
Wey] spinor, x(x), and the auxiliary field, F(z, @), (3.29) can be expressed

F(x,8) = 4(z) +8 x(x) + 0  OF(2) (3.30)
where we can see a factor } on the last term of (3.30) and this is chosen
conventionally to have a resemblance on the usual Taylor series expansion

[25]. We can also consider a more general supefield which involves a complex

conjugate of the Grassman coordinate, 6, given by [25]

S(z, 0,6) =A+0-x+0-A+6-6B+6-8C + 60"6U,,
(60"6)0 - OV, + (80"8)8 - OW, + 6-66 -OD (3.31)

3.3. The Superspace Formalism: Reproducing the Wess-Zumino
Lagrangian

where A,B.,...are scalar fields, U,,, V,, and W,, are the vector fields.

Recall that in the formulation of the Wess-Zumino Lagrangian, it involves
left-chiral fields which describe fermions or matter particles. With this, we

have to ensure that the superfields are left-chiral which describe fermions

and their corresponding superpartners [27]. To do this, we use the constraint
given by [25]
Dj Sic(z, 6, 6) =0 (3.32)
where [25]
Da= 0 “ ge( #) 49, 3.33
a— oo4 2 oO )ca9Pu ( . )

We can also extract the right-chiral superfields using the constraint [25]

DaSarc = 0 (3.34)
where [25] 9
is
Da = apa - 5026 On (3.35)

Using (3.30) with the implementation of the constraint in (3.32), the left-
chiral superfield is given by [25]

® = ¢(z) - $60"80,0(2) - x! - 00 - O(x)
9: x(z) - S0"0 - Onx(z) + 5F(2)8 6 (3.36)

We can observe from the mathematical structure of (3.36) that it is invariant
under the Lorentz transformation. We can now reproduce the Wess-Zumino
Lagrangian using the superspace formalism as follows: first, construct the su-
perpotential which is a product of left-chiral superfields, (1, ®2,...). From
this we now know why is it called superpotential” because it is a function of
”superfields”. Second, extract the F-term of superpotential, 7(®1, ®2,...)| ,
which is a supersymmetric Lagrangian density since it transforms with a total
derivative under SUSY. This can be carried out by performing the integral
[2]

[2006.8 ..) = W(G,, Bo, ...) (3.37)
F

3.3. The Superspace Formalism: Reproducing the Wess-Zumino

The integral can be evaluated using the property of Grassman integrals
(e.g.4 {66-6 =1). With this, the F-term of the superpotential, (,, ®,)

is given by [25]

where we have multiplied m,; in order to obtain a correct dimension for the
Lagrangian. Note that we have derived some terms in the interaction part
of the Wess-Zumino Lagrangian. To derive the remaining parts, we need to
multiply three left-chiral superfields, then, we have [25]

F

Then, the result is [25]
1
[cove ©;,O,) = Gist (Didi Fi + bbe Fi + Gide Fy
— PiX5 Xk — PjXk > Xi — ORXE* XG (3.40)
where we have multiplied a dimensionless quantity, 2 Yijks since terms are

symmetric under the exchange of any two indices. The free part of the Wess-

Zumino Lagrangian can be derived from the D-term of the product ®t6 given
by [25]

/ POPOS'D = HH (3.41)
which can be carried out using [25] °
i / @0d200 60-9 =1 (3.42)
The result is [25]
/ Podbb' = 0,o10"d + FFt + ixs"d,.x (3.43)

Then, the Wess-Zumino Lagrangian can be expressed in terms of the super-

fields given by [25]

3.4. SUSY Breaking

To summarize what we have discussed, a SUSY-invariant Lagrangian can
be extracted from the superpotential by obtaining the D- and the F-term
which correspond to the free and interaction parts of the Lagrangian, re-
spectively. This is the basic method of superspace formalism and it can be

applied when constructing supersymmetric Lagrangians on a more compli-
cated SUSY models [25-28].

3.4 SUSY Breaking

One way to confirm the validity of SUSY is to detect these elusive superpart-
ners but as of this writing, supersymmetry has not been validated through
collider experiments because there are no supersymmetric particles observed
in high energy collisions and processes [26, 27]. This does not mean that
SUSY is incorrect or there must be a problem within our colliders but it ap-
pears that SUSY particles must be heavier than their Standard Model part-
ners. This is because if SUSY particles and their corresponding superpartners
have the same masses, then we must immediately detect these superpartners,
now the fact that we haven’t detected these, it implies that they are in an en-
ergy scale beyond the reach of our current colliders as higher masses require
more energies [25, 27, 28]. Nevertheless, we do not want to rule out SUSY as
it has a lot to offer when it comes to solving the deficiencies of the Standard
Model and it also has a rich phenomenology [25. 27, 28]. However, the con-
sequence of this is that supersymmetry is not conserved but rather, broken.
Then, we must have a mechanism of SUSY breaking. There are two ways on
how we can break the SUSY, breaking SUSY spontaneously and softly. Let
us first discuss how we can break SUSY spontaneously [25-28, 57].

Recall that from our discussion of spontaneous symmetry breaking, it is
achieved when the field configuration corresponds to a state in which the

potential is minimum, mathematically, the condition is given by [25]
(0| V(¢i) |0) > 0 (3.45)

41

3.4. SUSY Breaking

Now in supersymmetry, the scalar potential, V(#;), can be expressed by

means of an F- and D-terms given by [25]

V(¢:) = Ve + Vp
V(6,) = RFI +50? (3.46)

From the condition given in (3.45), we don’t want a case in which both
vacuumm states of auxiliary fields vanish in order for us to have a spontaneous
symmetry breaking, otherwise, supersymmetry is still preseved if (0|F;|0) =
(0|F'|0) = (0|D|0) = 0. So with this, there exist two possible cases. The
first case is when (0|F)|0) = (0|F'|0) 4 0 no matter what the value of
(0|D|0) = 0. This case is called an F-type SUSY breaking where in this
scenario, the specific form of the superpotential, {/, must be strictly chosen
so that it satisfies the condition of nonvanishing vevs for F; and F! according
to the equation given by [25]
Ow

F} = 06 7
The second case is called the D-type SUSY breaking where (0|D|0) # 0 no
matter what the values of (0|F;|0) and (0|F}| [25]. However, these types of

0 (3.47)

SUSY breaking are not phenomenologically viable since SUSY particles are
expected to be heavier that their Standard Model partners [25, 27, 28].

Let us now tackle how we can break the SUSY softly. One of the main
advantage of SUSY is that it solves the hierarchy problem of SM where the
quadratic divergences that arise from loop calculations are naturally cancelled
in this framework [25]. To put it simply, SUSY have a way to erase these
large contributions to the tree-level Higgs mass since if we consider these
contributions, there is an inconsistency between the predicted and measured
value of the Higgs mass. We will discuss more on the hierarchy problem
in Chapter 4. Now, we break the SUSY softly thorough an addition of a
Lagrangian that breaks the SUSY softly, Zor, on top of the SUSY-preserving

42

3.5. The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM)

Lagrangian, “gusy. Thus, the Lagrangian is given by [25]
L = Lousy + Lott (3.48)
where [25, 26]
Laon = -65(h2),40, - 5 (Maren! +h.)
+ (JArnodson = 5 Buddy + Cio) + he.) (3.49)

where (3.49) contains mass terms and interactions among ¢,. Hence, in order
to generate the masses of SM and their corresponding superpartners within
the context of SUSY, we must break the supersymmetry by adding the soft-
SUSY breaking Lagrangian, A op, on top of SUSY-preserving Lagrangian,
“Susy [25, 26]. This is important when we discuss the model describing
superpartners of Standard Model particles known as the Minimal Supersym-
metric Standard Model (MSSM).

3.5 The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model (MSSM)

Supersymmetry incorporates superpartners for every SM particles, while re-
maining theoretically consistent with the Standard Model, through the model
called the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model or MSSM [1, 25, 27, 28}.
This model is consists of a chiral superfields, which contains SM fermions and
their corresponding bosonic superpartners. The vector supermultiplets of
the SU(3)c x SU(2), x U(1)y gauge interactions, which contains SM gauge
bosons and their corresponding fermionic superpartners. We can think of su-
permultiplets as a collective group containing SM and SUSY particles where
a group that contains SM fermions and their corresponding SUSY partners
is called the chiral multiplet while a group that contains SM gauge bosons

and their SUSY partners is called the vector supermultiplets [24]. Lastly the

Higgs and its superpartner, the higgsinos [1]. It is important to emphasize
that in MSSM, we have two types of Higgs which are the up- and down-
type Higgs. This is due to the requirement that superpotentials must be
a holomorphic function of superfields to avoid the problem of massless SM
particles even after performing spontaneous symmetry breaking. The phrase
“superpotentials must be a holomorphic function of superfields” means that
it should be a function of 6, not f [25].

Table 3.2 shows the composition of the MSSM superfields along with their
quantum numbers associated to the gauge group symmetry. The superpo-
tential of the MSSM is given by

where
Wyukewa = Yj Fabia Erg + phi Ori pg + Ys MaQ1. Drj (3.51)

contains the Yukawa interactions of Higgs to chiral superfields, w is the Hig-

gsino mass parameter, the first term on (3.50) is known as the p-term. A,

Recall from the discussion of the Wess-Zumino Lagrangian, the construction
of SUSY Lagrangian, “usy, is quite different from the conventional building
of Lagrangian from standard quantum field theory since it involves the so-

called F- and D-terms which are auxiliary fields in SUSY, that is, [25, 27, 28]

where B,, is the Higgs B-term and M23 are the gaugino mass parameters
with coupling gi, g2, and g3, respectively (26, 45].

The parameters of the SUSY-conserving sector of MSSM are as follows

[1]:

The parameters for the SUSY-breaking sector of MSSM include mass pa-
rameters from gauginos, sfermions and Higgs (Mj, Mo, M3, m2, m2, m3, mp,
me, mz. F) as well as trilinear interaction couplings from Higgs, squarks and

sleptons (Aé,, AZ

§, AG, Ai) [1]. Now, the result of spontaneous symmetry breaking

of the U(1)y x SU(2), group leads to the mixing of gauginos and Higgsinos,
the superpartners of SM gauge and Higgs bosons, respectively [25, 27, 28].

Let us discuss this in the next section.

3.6 Charginos and Neutralinos

The mixture of neutral gauginos, B° and W°, and neutral Higgsinos, H°
and HA, is called the neutralino. On the other hand, chargino is a result
of mixing charged Winos and higgsinos [28]. To determine the mass matri-

ces corresponding to chargino and neutralino, we start with the Lagrangian

47

3.6. Charginos and Neutralinos

breaking the supersymmetry given in (3.66). Now, together with the p-
term, the MSSM superpotential (3.50), and after the up- and down-type
Higgs fields acquire their corresponding vevs where Wea — Uya, the MSSM

we have [26]

ZTMYEMZ, = diag(mys) (3.71)

where m,+ (i=1,...,4) are the chargino masses, Z, and Z_ are the unitary
matrices. The MSSM chargino mass eigenstates can be obtained by diago-
nalizing the MSSM chargino mass matrix given in (3.70). Doing the diago-

nalization process, the results are [26]

where myo(i=1,...,4) are the neutralino masses, Zy is the unitary matrix.

3.7 R-parity and the Lightest Supersymmet-
ric Particle (LSP)

The MSSM Lagrangian given by (3.50) is invariant under a new symme-
try known as the R-parity symmetry [25]. This new U(1)y symmetry is
introduced to solve the problem of lepton and baryon number-violating in-
teractions which naturally arises in the MSSM superpotential. This is not
favorable from a phenomenological standpoint since these violations have the
capacity to result in an unobserved processes such as the rapid decay of pro-

ton or large flavor-changing neutral current [25, 27, 28]. To alleviate these

49

3.7. R-parity and the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP)

complications, an additional symmetry that is acting in a form of a U(1)
phase symmetry where it is a symmetry when the behaviour of the system
does not change when we apply some changes in its phases. For example,
we have an object that spins in some particular direction. Now, no matter
what angle we observe that object, it doesn’t change the speed at which the
object is spinning, then the objectc has phase symmetry. The U(1) phase

transformations are (25)

6 6 = e'%9 (3.78)
5 = 099 (3.79)

The above transformations can be further expressed in terms of matrices

(5) + else (5) (3.80)

The R-parity symmetry is when ¢ = 7. Recall that the F-term from the

given by [25]

superpotential, , can be extracted [25]

Ww

= / LOW (3.81)

which correspond to a SUSY-invariant Lagrangian. We can see from (3.81)
that superpotential must be invariant under R-parity symmetry so that the
MSSM Lagrangian is invariant under the aforementioned symmetry. The

R-parity of the component fields can be written as [25]
R= (ibe (3.82)

where B, L, and s are the baryon, lepton, and spin quantum numbers, re-
spectively. From (3.82), the R-pariy for Standard Model and supersymmetric

particles are [25]

R= {*t for Standard Model particles (3.83)

—1, for supersymmetric particles

50

3.8. Tree-Level Majorana Neutrino Mass in R-Parity Violating
(RPV) MSSM

That is, SM and SUSY particles have even and odd R-parities, respectively.

Now, the MSSM follows the conservation of R-parity, then, in order to ensure
that the R-parity is constant throughout the whole interaction process, SUSY
particles must be produced or decayed into at least two superpartners as
dictated by (3.83). These particles are a challenge when it comes to detection
in collider experiments because they exhibit instability and often transform
into states of lower masses. When an R-parity symmetry is preserved, these
states of lower masses would no longer decay and they are called the Lightest
Supersymmetric Particle (LSP). Additionally, these particles can act as a
dark matter since they are stable, electrically neutral, and weakly interacting

but as of this writing, LSP is not yet confirmed experimentally [1, 25, 27, 28].

3.8 Tree-Level Majorana Neutrino Mass in
R-Parity Violating (RPV) MSSM

What we have considered in the previous section is the case in which the
MSSM superpotential respects the R-parity symmetry. We can also con-
sider the case in which the MSSM superpotential is not invariant under the
R-parity conservation. The corresponding R-parity violating (RPV) super-
potential is given by [27]

Wrpy — pi Li Ay + Nijelil; Ex + NjnbiQeDr + Nini D; Dr (3.84)

where the mixing of lepton doublet superfield, L,, with the up-type Higgs
doublet superfield, H,, violates the lepton number conservation since Higgs
does not carry a lepton number. The second and third terms which are the
trilinear interactions also violate the lepton number conservation. The last
term violates the baryon number conservation since the up-type quark singlet
superfield, U;, does not carry a baryon number while the down-type quark
singlets, D, Des does [27]. Baryon and lepton numbers describe whether a

particle is a baryon or a lepton [3]. Breaking the R-parity symmetry can

3.8. Tree-Level Majorana Neutrino Mass in R-Parity Violating
(RPV) MSSM

lead to new avenues of research in supersymmetry since it has a new features

different to the case when the model respect the R-parity symmetry. One
implications of this is it allows us to generate the neutrino masses (26, 35, 58].

Note that in this trec-level calculation, they only obtained one flavor of neu-

trino mass where the other two flavor of neutrinos will have a vanishing mass
eigenvalues [59-62]. To show more on these, let us demonstrate the other
way of calculating the tree-level neutrino mass by means of diagonalizing the
MSSM tree-level fermion mass matrix, M‘). After performing the diagonal-
ization, we have [60]
(n)

Mieonatized = (Mir weiss) (3.98)

where Me and MNSSM are the effective MSSM neutralino and neutrino

the rank of a matrix determines the number of the nonzero eigenvalues. This

corresponds to the effective MSSM tree-level neutrino mass

mssm _ ©08°(8)M5M3 (ui + u3 + u3)
mes = y (3.97)
: b(—uM, M2 + sin(28) M; M3)

which matches the result from (3.92). We can also generate the tree-level
neutrino mass from the supersymmetric extensions of MSSM as we will dis-

cuss in the next chapter.

Chapter 4

Extensions of MSSM and The
Tree-Level Majorana Neutrino
Mass in NMSSM

This chapter will discuss the two challenges of MSSM which are the little
hierarchy and the w problems and how extensions of the aforementioned
model solve these two problems. This chapter will also introduce the tree-
level neutrino mass in R-parity violating Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model (RPV-NMSSM) obtained by [31].

4.1 Challenges of MSSM

4.1.1 The Little Hierarchy Problem

As we have learned from previous sections, the MSSM extends the particle
content of SM by incorporating superpartners for every SM particles. This
formulation of the model gave us a way of addressing some problems of
the Standard Model and one of which is the hierarchy problem [27]. What
exactly is this problem? When we calculate one-loop renormalized squared
mass correction, 6m?, for the Higgs mass, it has a large discrepancy to the

observed mass of the Higgs [25]. Now, the

Figure 4.1: Cancellation of quadratic divergences from one-loop
quantum correction to the squared Higgs mass due to a.) top quark
and b.) (s)top quark contributions.

MSSM alleviates this problem by introducing superpartners for top quarks
which are the (s)top quarks. As a result, the contribution of the the one-loop
correction to the Higgs mass is cancelled by combining the total contribution
of the top and (s)top quarks as shown by Figure 4.1 [25-28]. This sim-
ply means that SUSY has a way of erasing the large contributions for the
Higgs mass which would correspond to the measured value of the mentioned
quantity. Now, if we calculate the mass of the Higgs in the framework of

supersymmetry, the result is [25]
Mpo < Mz|cos(2{)| (4.1)

The value of the Higgs mass that we would get when we use (4.1) is in
complete disagreement to the effective masses of the Higgs and Z bosons
which are mpo = 125 GeV [9. 10] and mz = 91 GeV [63, 64], respectively.
Clearly, the MSSM prediction for the mass of the Higgs boson is inconsistent
with experiments [27]. This is called the Little Hierarchy Problem. Although
the calculated Higgs mass is a tree-level result which can be slightly modified

by including radiative corrections coming from the top and (s)top quarks, the

55

4.1. Challenges of MSSM

(s)top must be unnaturally heavy (~ 1 TeV) according to the equation given

by (25, 30]
3q2 m2 m2
myo < yr + ane (=). (4.2)

It is considered “unnatural” since we would not expect the (s)top quark to

be this kind of heavy and this raises a concern about the heaviness of (s)top

quark [24, 25].

4.1.2 The p Problem

The higgsino mass parameter, 4, appears in the p-term of a superpotential
as we have seen in our previous discussion. The y and the higgsinos must be
of the same scale since the j: parameter since the mass scales for higgsinos
are determined by the aforementioned parameter to avoid problems dealing
with fine-tuning [27]. The y-term in the MSSM superpotential, wy Ha, is
completely supersymmetric or SUSY preserving, then, one might expect the
parameter j: to be of order of magnitude of the Planck scale, Mp ~ 2.4 x
10!8 GeV. Another reason why p parameter is expected to be in that scale
is it helps to further stabilize the large quantum corrections received by the
tree-level Higgs mass thereby addressing the issue of the hierarchy problem,
but, phenomenology requires that the parameter in the order of electroweak
scale to be consistent with the scale of masses of W and Z bosons. We see that
there is an apparent contradiction between the theory and phenomenology
when it comes to the right scale of the parameter. This issue is known as the

p problem [30, 65, 66).

56

4.2. The Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(NMSSM)

4.2 The Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Stan-
dard Model (NMSSM)

To solve these problems we extend the MSSM by adding a Higgs singlet
superfield, 3, given by [25, 27, 28, 31, 32]

$=540.5456-0Fs (4.3)

This model is called the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(NMSSM). The Higgs singlet superfield contains the spin-0 SM Higgs singlet,
S, and its corresponding spin-} superpartner, S$, known as the singlino [67,
68]. The quantum numbers of this new superfield are shown on Table 4.2.
We can see from Table 4.2 that the Higgs singlet has a quantum numbers of
0, 1, and 1 under the U(1)y, SU(2)z, and SU(3)c¢ groups, respectively. In
simpler terms, the Higgs singlet is unaffected by the electroweak and strong
forces. This tells us that it doesn’t interact with particles associated to these
forces.

The NMSSM superpotential is given by [31]
Ay 1 «
Wyassm = AsS Hua + ru + Wyukawa (4.4)

where A, is the coupling parameter for Higgsino-singlino interaction and « is

the coupling parameter for the singlet self-interaction. Notice that the term

pH, Ha is not present in the {/ymssm because the yu term will be dynamically

generated by the vacuum expectation value of the singlet, v,, resulting to an
effective ys given by [31]

Meg = Aste (4.5)

Recall that we have discussed in the previous section that scalar potential

in supersymmetry is composed of an auxiliary fields, F and D. When these

auxiliary fields acquire a non-zero VEV, the result is an F- or a D-type

SUSY breaking. Then, in this scenario, the scale of the uNMSSM and the

SUSY breaking are naturally related to one another because the parameters

that break the SUSY can be determined from the VEVs. From this, we can
see that the NMSSM can address the issue of the » problem. Unfortunately,
the little hierarchy problem is not solve in NMSSM since the upper bound
of the Higgs mass is calculated to be [29]

22
™}, NMSSM < M2 (cos*(20) + AE sin*(28) J . (4.6)

We can see from (4.6) that there is an extra quartic coupling which increases
the upper bound of the Higgs mass but as tan@ —> 00, m?. nassm 7 ™}mssm>
but, as we take the limit as tans > oo, the second term of (4.6) vanishes
which reduces to the MSSM Higgs mass inequality given in (4.1). This tells
us that it doesn’t actually fix the little hierarchy problem of MSSM [30].
Hence, we must find a way that in the aforementioned limit, the Higgs mass

must not be suppressed.

58

4.3. The Triplet Extended Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model (TMSSM)

4.3. The Triplet Extended Minimal Supersym-
metric Standard Model (TMSSM)

We have seen from NMSSM that it doesn’t solve the little hierarchy problem
due to the fact that the effect of the Higgs quartic coupling vanishes in the
limit as tan3 — oo. To fix this problem we have to find another source of that
coupling which will not decouple in the aforementioned limit [30]. Another
extension of MSSM is called the Triplet extended Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model (TMSSM) where we add a hypercharge-neutral (Y = 0)
Higgs triplet superfield, T. The Higgs triplet superfield contains the spin-0
SM Higgs triplet, T, and the corresponding SUSY partner which is the spin-}

triplino, T, expressed as [29, 30, 34]
T= I T° v2Tt 1, . T° v2r*

Po VaF :) (4.7)

+70-8( fe _ po
where 7°, T+, and T- are the components of the triplet superfield, hence
the name ” triplet”. The quantum numbers of this new superfield are shown

on Table 4.3. The superpotential for TMSSM is given by [29]
Wraussm = Wussm + MyTr(TT) + Hal Ay + arTr(T) (4.8)

where Mr is the mass parameter of triplino, A; is the coupling parameter for
the Higgsino-triplino interaction and ar is a Lagrange multiplier determined
from the potential. The hypercharge-neutral (Y = 0) triplet superfield, T, is
given by [29]

T= sotrA (4.9)
where o4 is the Pauli spin matrices. We can see from Table 4.3 that the Higgs
triplet has a quantum numbers of 0, 3, and 1 under the U(1)y, SU(2)z, and
SU(3)c groups, respectively. That is, the Y = 0 Higgs triplet is unaffected by
color and electromagnetic forces. Meaning it doesn’t interact with particles

associated to these forces.

Now, the added Higgs triplet modify the Higgs quartic coupling we encoun-
tered from the NMSSM. This modified Higgs quartic coupling is not sup-
pressed as tan — oo thereby solving the little hierarchy problem (29, 30].
Unfortunately, TMSSM doesn’t address the y problem since the p-term is
present in the TMSSM superpotential.

4.4 The Triplet Next-to-Minimal Supersym-
metric Standard Model (TNMSSM)

To summarize what we have discussed so far there are two challenges of
MSSM, the little hierarchy problem and yp problem. The TMSSM ameliorates
the former while the NMSSM fixes the latter problem. It is interesting to

have a model that simultaneously solves the two problems. We can achieve

this by combining these two extensions of MSSM which we call the Triplet
Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (TNMSSM) where it has

a Higgs singlet superfield §, and a hypercharge-neutral (Y = 0) Higgs triplet
superfield, 7 [30, 33, 69]. The TNMSSM superpotential is given by [30, 33,

and we can solve the p problem using the singlet vev [30, 33, 69].

In the next chapter, we will show how we can determine the tree-level Majo-
rana neutrino masses beyond the singlet extensions of supersymmetry which

are the R-parity violating versions of TMSSM and TNMSSM.

4.6. Neutrino Mass on the Other Extensions of MSSM

4.6 Neutrino Mass on the Other Extensions
of MSSM

4.6.1 The pySSM

Aside from the aforementioned SUSY models we have discussed, there are
other supersymmetric extensions of MSSM that deal with generating the
neutrino masses. One of which is the so-called pySSM where in this model,
it introduces the gauge singlet neutrino superfields, /;, in order to solve the pz
problem instead of the Higgs singlet superfield, §, we have seen from NMSSM
(70, 71]. The superpotential for this model is [71]

ne my 1
Wa ssm = Wyukawa + Yj AuLiW; _ ND, HaHa + gh bidyt (4.16)

where Y;¥,

’, and «* are the coupling parameters for the trilinear interac-
tions describe by the last three terms of (4.16). We can notice that the term
is also not present from the W,,ssm similar to the NMSSM and TNMSSM
supcerpotentials. This is because the effective » term will be dynamically gen-
erated by the vev of the supersymmetric component of the singlet neutrino

superfield, (i;), which is given by [71]
weg = X'(i) (4.17)

This is how ywvSSM provides a solution to the 4 problem provided the '
must be of order ©(1) [71]. In this model, the generation of the masses of
light neutrinos is similar to that of seesaw mechanism where the mass matrix

can be expressed as [70, 71]
MY = —m3x7M;),m3 7 (4.18)

The mixing of neutralinos and right-handed neutrinos is contained in M77
where its components are of order of electroweak scale, ©(107) GeV. On the
other hand, the mixing of neutralinos and left-handed neutrinos as well as

the mixing of right- and left-handed neutrinos are contained in m3x7 where

63

4.6. Neutrino Mass on the Other Extensions of MSSM

the scale of its components is around ©(10~*) GeV. Solving the eigenvalues
of (4.18) gives rise to three light neutrinos at tree-level (70, 71]. In our work,
we will be generating the tree-level neutrino mass from the bilinear R-parity
violating (RPV) interactions which implies that right-handed neutrinos are
not present in our study. Also, the Higgs singlet and triplet superfields are
present in our work which has an advantage when it comes to constrain-
ing SUSY mass parameters of singlino and triplino using the observable of

neutrino mass.

4.6.2 Flavored-TNMSSM

Another supersymmetric extension of MSSM is the so-called flavored-TNMSSM
which is basically the TNMSSM we have discussed in section 4.4 with an
added flavor symmetry group, Ay x £3 [72]. With this, on top of the su-
perfields we explained in section 4.4 for TNMSSM, there will be another
superfields added in this model called the flavon superfields, ® and 2. In ad-
dition to this, there will be an added quantum numbers for every superfields
under the flavor symmetry group. Also, the Higgs triplets in this model,
A, and Ag, have an U(1)y hypercharge of -2 and 2, respectively [73]. The

neutrino masses can be generated from the superpotential [73]
A A
Wiepo = aT r(LAgL) + FTr(LAdLS) + FTr(LAaLo) (4.19)

after performing the breaking of the flavor and electroweak symmetries which
give rise to the nonzero vev of Ag, S, and 2 [73]. In our study, we will be
using the “vanilla” structure of TMSSM and TNMSSM with hyperchargeless
triplet superfield in which we didn’t modify the symmetry group and field

content of the said models.

64

Chapter 5

Neutrino Masses Beyond the
Singlet Extension of
Supersymmetry

In this chapter, we will generate the tree-level mass of neutrino from various
supersymmetric models. We will also analyze the neutrino mass suppressions

from plots as a functions of mass and coupling parameters.0||

5.1 The Tree-Level Majorana Neutrino Mass
in RPV TMSSM

This section presents the result for tree-level neutrino mass in the Triplet Ex-
tended Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The correspond-
ing limiting case of the result and analysis of neutrino mass suppressions
from the triplino mass and triplino-higgsino coupling parameters are also

presented in this section.

5.1.1 Mass Expression in RPV TMSSM

We have established earlier that there are no mass-generating mechanism for
neutrinos in the Standard Model. We also showed that lepton and baryon

numbers in that model are always conserved thus, R-parity symmetry is

65

5.1. The Tree-Level Majorana Neutrino Mass in RPV TMSSM

always preserved in SM. Now, supersymmetric extensions of the Standard
Model are not restricted to R-parity violation in which either the lepton or
baryon number is not conserved. The Majorana masses of neutrinos can
be generated from R-parity violating versions of SUSY extensions of SM by
considering the bilinear R-parity violating (ft,) interactions contained in the

superpotential [31]
WanyesM = Womissm + pili Hy (5.1)

where 4; are dimension-one ft, parameters. The mixings between neutrinos
and neutralinos will be produced by the vacuum expectation value (vev)
of sneutrinos after electroweak symmetry breaking due to the presence of
bilinear R-parity violating soft terms. What the latter statement means is
that the vev of sneutrinos allows the interaction between neutrinos and its
SUSY partners [24, 31]. In this formalism the Z3 baryon triality is conserved
which means that the R-parity violating (RPV) interactions violate lepton
number but conserve baryon number. We can think of Z3 baryon triality as
another symmetry group that is related to baryons [27, 31].

Let us recall the hyperchargeless (Y = 0) TMSSM superpotential dis-
cussed in Chapter 4 given by [29]

Wrmssm = Hal Ae + MrTr(TT) + aTr(T) + nH, Ha + Wulewa (5.2)

That is, the -term is present in the TMSSM superpotential so that the
soft SUSY-breaking Lagrangian term associated with the Higgs sector for
TMSSM can read as follows:

and we are only interested in a specific part of Lagrangian that contains the

mixing of neutrinos with neutralino since from this mixing, we can generate

67

5.1. The Tree-Level Majorana Neutrino Mass in RPV TMSSM

the tree-level Majorana neutrino mass. It is again worth noting that the
mixing of neutralino and neutrino is a result of breaking the R-parity sym-
metry characterized by a nonzero vev of sneutrino [25, 71]. Another reason
for this mixing is that neutrino and neutralino both correspond to neutral
states [27, 28].

In the basis defined by Yussq = {B°, W°, 11°, F°, T°}, the TMSSM
neutralino Lagrangian is given by

The tree-level masses of neutralino-neutrino and neutrino can be obtained
through performing the Takagi diagonalization of the mass matrices, MIMSSM
and MyM, respectively. Note that a diagonalized matrix is a matrix
whose components in the off-diagonal elements are zero while the remaining
components are non-zero which correspond to the eigenvalues of that matrix.
Now, the masses of particles can be extracted from the elements of a diagonal
(or a square) matrix which are none other than the eigenvalues (3. 7].

What will happen if we have a non-diagonal matrix where the off-diagonal
elements are not zeroes? In this case, we have to diagonalize this matrix
by using specific transformation that will make the matrix diagonal. Part

of diagonalization process is finding the cigenvalues in which, as we have

69

5.1. The Tree-Level Majorana Neutrino Mass in RPV TMSSM

mentioned earlier, correspond to the masses of particles [3, 7]. Note that
neutrino is mixed with neutralino in a mass matrix, then, in order to extract
the mass of neutrino we have to compute for the product of eigenvalues of
the neutralino-neutrino mass matrix then divide it with the product of the
neutralino mass matrix so that the result that will remain is the neutrino
mass. Now, the product of eigenvalues is equivalent to the determinant of
a matrix [45]. Then, instead of going through diagonalization process, we
just have to compute for the determinant of the neutralino-neutrino mass
matrix then divide it by the determinant of the neutralino mass matrix.
This method is used in the previous studies that generates the neutrino mass
within a specific SUSY models [29, 31].
On the tree-level, we have [31, 35]
TMSSM _ D et! (Mie) (5.17)

where

Det(M3eS™) = M; MZ (uj oF + 2(sin(28)M; Mr Mz

— 2M, Mo Mr (yan)? (5.19)

Take note that Det’ corresponds to the product of the nonzero eigenvalues
of MZMSSM. Note that we can express 5.18 as

24,24 2
tTmssm _ Hi t+ Ho + 3 2 5.20
m, = Det(MTNS5My MM2Mr (200s (8) M,My + Mr ) (5.20)

The first term on (5.19) represents an associated exchange of gaugino while
the second term correspond to the associated exchange of triplino, T°. We
can observe from this equation the ” cancellation mechanism”, that is, this

cancellation can lead to suppression of neutrino mass similar to what [31] was

70

5.1. The Tree-Level Majorana Neutrino Mass in RPV TMSSM

observed in NMSSM. Thus, a cancellation between the contribution coming
from the exchanges of a gaugino and a triplino would result to the smallness
of the neutrino mass. The other possible source of neutrino mass suppression
can come from the second term of (5.19) which contains the triplino mass
parameter, Mr and triplino-higgsino coupling parameter, »;. Notice the
similarity of

We shall demonstrate from the next sections that these two parameters
are involved in the ”compensation mechanism” to suppress the neutrino mass.
The other source of neutrino mass suppression can come from the ratio of
the RPV couplings, ;, and the higgsino mass parameter, p, [4 wherein we
use 4 ~ 107! since p ~ 10? and p; ~ 1073.

Similar to what we discussed in section 3.8, we can also calculate the

tree-level neutrino mass by means of diagonalizing the TMSSM neutralino-

which is exactly what we obtained from our previous calculation. It is worth
recognizing again in this section that an effective rank-1 neutrino mass ma-
trix emerged from the diagonalization due to the form of 7J MSSM from (5.15)

which has a single nonzero column and row while the rest of elements are
TMSSM

zeroes which is what makes (5.22) a rank 1 matrix. The structure of 7,
comes from the bilinear R-parity term we added from the TMSSM superpo-
tential which is wiliAy.

This is reminiscent of the fact that in the tree-level setting, the RPV
TMSSM superpotential ‘23MS5M we used which has an added bilinear RPV
term in Wrpy from (3.84) only generates one flavor of neutrino mass. The
masses of the other two flavor of neutrinos are generated through one-loop
correction from second and third terms of (3.84) which correspond to the
trilinear interactions where ;;, and j;, are the RPV coupling parameters
for those interactions. The fact that we didn’t add these RPV trilinear terms

72

5.1. The Tree-Level Majorana Neutrino Mass in RPV TMSSM

to the TMSSM superpotential gives us an idea that it’s natural to expect the
we will only generate one flavor of neutrino mass from tree-level calculation

[35, 40, 74]. The loop-calculation is beyond the scope of this work.

5.1.2 Limiting Case

It is of interest to determine the validity of our result by determining the
limiting case of (5.18) where the triplino decouples with higgsino as A, > 0

which will result to

2 2 2 2 2
TMSSM cos*(3)M5 M3 (ui + ue + 3) MSSM
v M7 0) = ; =m* 5.28
my > 0) = Ms + sin(28)M;M3) (5.28)

That is, the TMSSM tree-level neutrino mass reduces to the MSSM result in

the decoupling limit since in this limit the A, dependence in higgsino vanishes.
We can also obtain the same result by taking A/y — oo, the MSSM limit.

5.1.3 Plots for Tree-Level Majorana Neutrino Mass in
RPV TMSSM

The parameters in this model are Mz, Ow, Ut, M1, M2, and pz, pw, tan(), vu,
va, My, Mo, pIMSSM | Mr, and »;. The observed values for the mass of the
Z boson, Mz, and the Weinberg mixing angle, Ow, are Mz = 91.189 GeV
and Ow = 0.512 rad. The triplet vev, 1, is u, = 2 GeV. The values for the
other parameters are obtained from [31] since they used an RPV model in
their work as well as from (29, 33] wherein they used the non-RPV version

of TMSSM and TNMSSM. These are given by

M, = 1000 GeV, Mz = 2000 GeV
p= 200 GeV, tan(8) = 1.877
Vy = 211.622 GeV, vg = 112.735 GeV (5.29)

73

5.1. The Tree-Level Majorana Neutrino Mass in RPV TMSSM

The RPV couplings are

jy =1x 1073
Ha = 2x 1073
y3 = 3 x 10-3 (5.30)

We will consider the case in which the TMSSM effective higgsino mass pa-
rameter, pJMSSM | is approximately equal with the MSSM higgsino mass pa-
rameter, p, such that u7MSSM ~ pp ~ 200 GeV.

We should emphasize that the values of specific parameters are not guar-
anteed to be excluded or not in the viable parameter space of the model, that
is, if we are going to implement a specific value of a parameter, scans must
be performed in order to have a significant parameter space to a specific
parameter point constrained within experiments, simulations and physical
limitations. Then, instead of the specific values of tree-level neutrino mass,
the important aspect we should be looking for is the behaviour of mass and
coupling parameters with respect to the neutrino mass. The result is phe-
nomenologically viable since mass parameters in SUSY models are not yet

excluded in the TeV scale.

Neutrino Mass as a Function of Triplino Mass and Triplino-Higgsino
Coupling Parameters

The tree-level neutrino mass given by (5.18) is plotted as a function of My
where we used ; = 0.3. Figure 5.1 shows that the triplino mass parameter
has positive contribution to the neutrino mass suppression since the trend
manifested from the plot is decreasing with respect to decreasing mass of
neutrino. This means that TMSSM allows the new parameter, Mr, to be in
the SUSY breaking (TeV) scale. The result is phenomenologically viable since
new parameters in SUSY models specifically, the triplino mass parameter, are
not yet excluded in the TeV scale. The result also offers another method of

constraining the triplino mass parameter using an observable in particular,

74

5.1. The Tree-Level Majorana Neutrino Mass in RPV TMSSM

the neutrino mass, by determining the experimental lower bound for the
aforementioned mass but currently, experimental values for upper bound is
only available as of this writing as shown by Table 1.1.

It is also plotted as a function of 4; where we used Mr = 5000 GeV.
The trend is increasing with respect to decreasing neutrino mass as shown
by Figure 5.2. This means that the neutral triplino-higgsino coupling param-
eter has a negative contribution to the neutrino mass suppression. We also
highlight that couplings are taken to be small from the condition enforced
by a perturbative theory and this is consistent in the model as it excludes
higher values of coupling within the experimental upper bounds of neutrino

mass.

The Compensation and Cancellation Mechanisms of TMSSM Pa-
rameters

As we have said in the previous section, there are two resulting mecha-
nisms that suppress the neutrino mass which are the cancellation and com-
pensation mechanisms. Let us first illustrate the compensation mechanism
which can be shown by plotting the triplino mass parameter, A/7, as a func-
tion of the triplino-higgsino coupling parameter, 44, where we have used
my = 1.0 x 10-9 GeV. We can see an increasing trend from Figure 5.3, now
in order to explain this, recall that the triplino-higgsino coupling parameters
has negative contributions with respect to the neutrino mass suppressions
then, as \; increases, the neutrino mass also increases. The Mr should have
to compensate by increasing in order to suppress the neutrino mass since
it has a positive contribution with respect to the suppression. This is a
manifestation of the compensation mechanism.

77

5.1. The Tree-Level Majorana Neutrino Mass in RPV TMSSM

To show the other mechanism, we plot the bino mass parameter, Mj,
as a function of the triplino mass parameter, M/7, where we used \, = 0.3
and m, = 1.0 x 10-9 GeV. We also plot the Afr as a function of Af, using
the same values of 4; and m,. Figures 5.4 and 5.5 show the cancellation
mechanism in which the M, becomes more negative as Mr becomes more
positive and vice versa in order to ensure the suppression of neutrino mass
via the cancellation mechanism. It is important to note here that these mass
parameters do not necessarily correspond to the physical masses of the bino
and triplino because they are part of a mixture that constitutes neutralino
[25, 27, 46]. The approximated tree-level physical mass of neutralino can be
obtained from the eigenvalues of a tree-level neutralino mass matrix. It is
also significant to discuss here the implication of a negative mass parameter
which can be observed when one breaks the symmetry. A good example
of this is in the Higgs mechanism, the squared Higgs mass parameter, j/?,
from the squared Higgs mass term, p¢'¢, in the Higgs potential is chosen to
be negative in order to break the electroweak symmetry of the Lagrangian
resulting to emergence of the masses of SM particles. The breaking of sym-
metry is characterized by a nonzero Higgs vev, v. Now, we can see that the
second term of (5.5) which contributes to the TMSSM soft-SUSY breaking
Lagrangian is analogous to the squared Higgs mass term from the Higgs po-

tential. We can also observe from £{MSSM

that the triplet acquired a vev,
u,, after SUSY breaking which implies that the triplino mass parameter is
not restricted to be negative [3, 24].

Similarly, M4, and M2 which correspond to the Bino and Wino mass
parameters, are not restricted to have a negative values reminiscent pf the
B/W fields in electroweak theory [46]. It is also vital to point out that the
terms 1M, B°B° and 1MRWwow? that appeared in TMSSM Lagrangian are
not actually mass terms because B® and W? are still mixed with other SUSY
fields characterized by a bilinear interaction with H° and H$. Additionally,

the Lagrangian where those terms are manifested is not yet diagonalized.

78

5.1. The Tree-Level Majorana Neutrino Mass in RPV TMSSM

We can observe from the TMSSM tree-level Majorana neutrino mass ex-
pression that two gaugino and one triplino mass parameters, M,, M2, and
My; appear. One might ask which one of these mass parameters will be nega-
tive. Provided that the neutrino mass is fixed, the answer lies on what mass
parameter is arbitrarily chosen as dependent variable. That is, when one
solves the Mr as a function of any one of the gaugino mass parameter, Afr
would be automatically negative while the gaugino mass parameter chosen
as independent variable will be positive. In our result using their relationship
via the neutrino mass equation, when one is positive, the other one is negative
(for a given neutrino mass) and vice versa but which one could be negative
is arbitrary. In fact, outside this relationship, the three mass parameters can

take on negative values.

The Decoupling Limit of TMSSM

We have shown on the previous section that from (5.18), we can analytically
obtained the MSSM tree-level neutrino mass expression using the decoupling
limits. To emphasize, we plot the MSSM and TMSSM tree-level neutrino
mass expressions from (5.28) and (5.18) as a function of bino mass parameter,
M,, where we have used A/7 = 5000 GeV and 2; = 0.3. Figures 5.6 and 5.7
show that as Mr — oo and ; — 0, the TMSSM matches the result from
the MSSM. Then, the extension of MSSM by adding a triplet superfield also
contributes to the origin of neutrino mass which are the gaugino-triplino

cancellation and Mr — ; compensation mechanisms.

5.2 The Tree-Level Majorana Neutrino Mass
in RPV TNMSSM

In this section, we will present the tree-level neutrino mass in the Triplet
Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (TNMSSM). We will also
discuss the limiting cases of our result and analysis of neutrino mass sup-
pressions from the singlino and triplino mass parameters as well as from the

singlino- and triplino-higgsino coupling paramaters.

5.2.1 Mass Expression in RPV TNMSSM

The singlet (NMSSM) and triplet (TMSSM) superfields are combined in one
model called the TNMSSM to solve both the little hierarchy and the p-
problem. Recall the hyperchargeless (Y = 0) TNMSSM superpotential given
by (30, 33% 69]
ar 1 « nn an

Wrnossm = AsS HuHa + 3S + :HaT Hy + ASTY(TT) + Wyurawa (5.31)
That is, there is no associated y-term in the TNMSSM superpotential similar
to NMSSM. We have a new term in the superpotential for this model describ-
ing the interaction of singlet and triplet. With this, the soft SUSY-breaking
Lagrangian is

5.2.2 Limiting Cases

It is also interesting to obtain the limiting cases of (5.45). For the case in
which the triplino decouples to Higgsino (\; > 0) and singlino (A > 0), we

have

2 2 2
mINMSSM(), 0, A > 0) = 7 Ha =H (cos*(8) Mj MsMZ

where

which is just the NMSSM tree-level neutrino mass expression,
mINMSSM(), —5 0, A — 0) + mNMSSM (5.49)
We can also obtain the same limiting case when My — 00 and A > 0,

mINMSSM (Yip > 00, A > 0) > mNMSSM (5.50)

We will also consider the case in which the TNMSSM effective higgsino mass
parameter, p2NMSSM, are approximately equal with the MSSM higgsino mass

parameter, p. Then, we have PINMSSM x, yTMSSM ~ y, ~ 200 GeV. With

85

5.2. The Tree-Level Majorana Neutrino Mass in RPV TNMSSM

this approximation, the TNMSSM tree-level neutrino mass reduces to the
TMSSM result as the singlino decouples with the Higgsino (A, — 0) and

triplino (A — 0) as well as Ms — 00, we have

2 2 2
mINMSSM ( } , , 0,A 5 0) = M+ a THs M,M2Mr

where
Y = Mj M3 (vio + 2(sin(28)M;MrMZ

which is just the TMSSM tree-level neutrino mass expression,
mTNMSSM(), — 0, A > 0) > mI MSSM (5.53)
The limiting case can also be obtained from
mI NMSSM ( fs — 00, A + 0) > mIMSSM (5.54)

We can also extract the MSSM tree-level neutrino mass from TNMSSM result

as follows:

m™NMSSM(), —+ 0, 1g + 0) = my MSSM( Mr — 00, Mg > 00)
cos?(B)M5M3 (ui + 43 + 43)
~ p(—wM, Mp + sin(28)M;M3)

(5.55)

which is just the MSSM tree-level neutrino mass expression. Then, MSSM,
NMSSM and TMSSM tree-level neutrino mass expressions can all be ex-
tracted from TNMSSM result provided that u7NMSSM rw NMSSM x y {MSSM

b.

86

5.2. The Tree-Level Majorana Neutrino Mass in RPV TNMSSM

For the case in which jij ’MS°M # MSSM # ys = 200 GeV, the result will
not reproduce both the MSSM and TMSSM tree-level neutrino mass expres-
sions due to the fact that the j-term (j:/,H) is present in the MSSM and
TMSSM superpotential while there is no y-term in the TNMSSM superpo-

tential.

5.2.3 Plots for Tree-Level Majorana Neutrino Mass in
RPV TNMSSM

The parameters and the corresponding values in this model are the same to
that of TMSSM with the addition of Ms, A,, and A. The singlino-triplino
coupling parameter, A are taken to be A = 0.1 obtained from the sample

values used by [33].

Neutrino Mass as a Function of Singlino/Triplino Mass and Singlino-
/Triplino-Higgsino Coupling Parameters

The TNMSSM tree-level neutrino mass given by (5.45) is plotted as a func-
tion of Mr and Mg where we used ; = A, = 0.3. Both trends from figures
5.8 and 5.10 are decreasing with respect to decreasing neutrino mass which
means that both singlino and triplino mass parameters have positive contri-
bution to the neutrino mass suppression. The TNMSSM also allows mass
parameters, Afy and Ms, to be in the SUSY breaking scale. In addition to
this, the aforementioned figures also show the decoupling limit of TNMSSM
to TMSSM and NMSSM as mass parameters approach to infinity in par-
ticular, the TNMSSM tree-level neutrino mass matches to the TMSSM and
NMSSM tree-level results as Ms — 00 and My — ©0, respectively. Take note
that TNMSSM reduces to TMSSM even though we clearly stated that the
TNMSSM result will not reduce to TMSSM since there is no inherent py-term
in the TNMSSM superpotential. This is because we numerically constrain
the TMSSM effective higgsino mass parameter to be approximately equal to

the MSSM higgsino mass parameter in order to ensure that those parameters

87

5.2. The Tree-Level Majorana Neutrino Mass in RPV TNMSSM

are within the electroweak symmetry breaking scale. Notice the similarity
of the mathematical structure of the NMSSM and TMSSM tree-level Majo-
rana neutrino masses and this might give us an impression that triplino and
singlino has similar contributions to the vanilla formulation of TNMSSM but
the effect of adding a triplet to NMSSM (or a singlet to TMSSM) significantly
decrease the suppression of neutrino mass as we can see from Figures 5.8 and
5.10 where the NMSSM and TMSSM are the lower bounds for TNMSSM
since the mentioned models are the limits of TNMSSM as discussed earlier.
We also emphasize that TMSSM has the inherent problem that NMSSM
solves, that’s why we also proceeded with TNMSSM (both solves mu and
little hierarchy problem) and see the effect to the tree-level mass of the neu-
trino. We saw that indeed, TMSSM has the same effect with the singlino
formulation, but with TNMSSM we noticed a new observation, that is, in
trying to solve both the mu and little hierarchy problems (in TNMSSM), we
pay the price of reducing the mass suppression mechanism.

The TNMSSM tree-level neutrino mass is also plotted as a function of ;
and \, where Afy = Ms = 500 GeV. The trend is increasing with respect to
decreasing neutrino mass from both figures 5.9 and 5.11 showing the these
coupling parameters have negative contribution to the neutrino mass sup-
pression. As a result, the TNMSSM also doesn’t allow coupling parameters
to be non-perturbative. Figures 5.9 and 5.11 also show that limit of TN-
MSSM as the couplings approach to zero specifically, as \; > 0 and A, — 0,
the TNMSSM tree-level neutrino mass matches to the TMSSM and NMSSM

results, respectively.

The Decoupling Limit of TNMSSM

We have seen that the TNMSSM tree-level neutrino mass matches to that
of TMSSM and NMSSM results provided that the effective higgsino mass
parameter is approximate equal to that of MSSM higgsino mass parameter.

Now, TNMSSM also reduces to that of MSSM result. To show this, we

plot the MSSM, NMSSM, TMSSM and TNMSSM tree-level neutrino masses
given by (5.28), (5.47), (5.18), (5.45) as a function of bino parameter, Afi,
where we have used Mr = Aly = 5000GeV and = A, = 0.3. Figures 5.12
and 5.13 show that as Mr = Ms > oo and \} = A, — 0, the TNMSSM
tree-level neutrino mass matches to that of MSSM result. This behaviour
reflects the decoupling property of the model that is, if TNMSSM reduces to
TMSSM, NMSSM and MSSM, we have to take the limit as either the mass
parameter becomes too heavy or the coupling becomes too small in which
both cases correspond to a more suppressed neutrino mass so we would expect
that among all four models (MSSM, NMSSM, TMSSM, and TNMSSM), the
neutrino mass is highly suppressed in MSSM.

The Cancellation and Compensation Mechanisms of TNMSSM Pa-
rameters

The cancellation and compensation mechanisms are also present in TN-
MSSM. We plot the bino mass parameter, M,, as a functions of the triplino
and singlino mass parameters, A/y; and Mg where we used ; = », = 0.3 and
my, = 1.0 x 10°® GeV. We also plot the Mr and fg, as a function of Ah;
using the same values of coupling parameters and neutrino mass. Figures
5.14 - 5.17 show the characteristic property of the cancellation mechanism
we have discussed in the TMSSM section for both the singlino and triplino
mass parameters.

We also plot the triplino and singlino mass parameters as a functions of
triplino- and singlino-higgsino coupling parameters, 4; = A, = 0.3 where
m, = 1.0 x 10-° GeV. A compensation mechanisms between Aly — »,
and Ms — A, are manifested from figures 5.18 and 5.19 since the trend is
increasing with respect to these parameters. Thus, in TNMSSM, there is
an added compensation mechanism coming from A/s and A, on top of the
Mr and »;. Then, the extension of MSSM by adding a triplet and a singlet
superfields resulted in the combined contributions coming from the gaugino-
triplino and gaugino-singlino cancellation mechanisms. The Mr — », and
As — A; compensation mechanisms also contribute to the origin of neutrino
mass suppression.

In addition to these, Figures 5.20 and 5.21 show plots of singlino- and
triplino-higgsino coupling parameters as a functions of triplino and singlino
mass parameters, respectively. The trends from these plots exhibit a neg-
ative contributions from couplings and positive contributions from triplino
and singlino masses which are consistent with what we previously observe re-
garding the contributions of couplings and mass parameters to the neutrino

mass suppression.

Conclusions and Future Work

We have considered the Triplet Extended Minimal Supersymmetric Stan-
dard Model (TMSSM), which ameliorate the little hierarchy problem, and
the Triplet Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (TNMSSM),
which solves both the little heirarchy and the yu problems, in the presence of
the bilinear R-parity violating interactions, piLily. A tree-level Majorana
neutrino mass expressions were derived in TMSSM and TNMSSM and they
are consistent with the MSSM limit provided that po ¥ wu.

We have found that there are two mechanisms that suppress the Majo-
rana neutrino mass which are as follows: First, the cancellation mechanism
that depends on the gaugino-singlino and gaugino-triplino mass parameters
and the second one is the compensation mechanism that relies on the ex-
istence of 4, — Ms and 2; — A/p. Furthermore, we also found out that the
trends of the mass and coupling parameters with respect to the neutrino mass
are decreasing and increasing, respectively. The former result also tells us
that the singlino and triplino mass parameters have positive contribution to
the Majorana neutrino mass suppression which is phenomenologically viable
since mass parameters in SUSY models are not yet excluded in the region of
high-energy scale. It also tells us that we can have a method of constraining
these mass parameters using an observable specifically, the neutrino mass.

The latter result shows that singlino-higgsino and triplino-higgsino coupling

98

parameters have negative contribution to the Majorana neutrino mass sup-
pression reflecting the condition of perturbation that couplings must be taken
to be small.

Using our results, we realized a new observation that TNMSSM pay a
price of reducing neutrino mass suppression mechanism in trying to solve the
mu and the little hierarchy problems. We also emphasize that the results of
this study can be used to constrain SUSY parameters using neutrino mass,
and vice versa, as data from both sides become available. However, a full nu-
merical scan is needed in order to determine which regions in the parameter
space are not yet excluded by experiments, simulations, and physical con-
straints which is beyond the scope of our work. Another possible extension
of this work is to consider the loop corrections because the measured values

of neutrino mass correspond to the tree-level + loop contributions.
