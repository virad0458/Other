ABSTRACT

Sensory evaluation and acceptability of 11 proportions of cookies revealed that the
cookies from 90:10 giant swamp taro — Obatanpa-x-Lagkitan (GST-OxL) corn flours was
the most acceptable formulation in terms of aroma and flavor and was rated “liked
moderately”. The OxL corn flour and its cookies, GST flour and its cookies and the 90:10
GST-OxL corn cookies were analyzed for their nutritional value and were subjected to
storage stability tests. Proximate composition except for crude fat, carbohydrate profile
and mineral content had significantly decreased (p<0.05) after processing flours into
cookies. The total dietary fiber and β-carotene content were significantly higher when
processed into cookies. Based from the Codex Alimentarius, the OxL corn flour, GST
flour, OxL corn cookies, GST-OxL corn cookies and GST cookies are sources of energy,
protein, iron and zinc. Cookies maintained their quality and acceptability throughout their
one month storage at room temperature. There was a significant and strong positive
correlation between microbial count and length of storage. Significant but strong negative
correlation was observed between microbial count and general acceptability. Sensory
characteristics and general acceptability were negatively correlated as storage period
increased.

INTRODUCTION

Ready-to-eat foods are pre-processed foods that are normally packed and served or
consumed when required (Brasava et al. 2013). Among the processed foods, bakery
products have wide popularity as a snack food in rural as well as urban areas among all
the age groups. Snack foods such as biscuits and crackers receive less attention than
bread. However, they offer several important advantages including: wide consumption,
relatively long shelf life, good eating quality, highly palatable and acceptable in most
countries and can be modified to suit specific nutritional needs of any target population
(Elkhalifa and El-Tinay 2002).

Biscuit is the term used in the European countries and cookies in the United States of
America. In general, cookies are formulated with high levels of shortening, sugar and low
moisture contents as compared to biscuits (Hui et al. 2006). Cookies differ from other
baked products like breads and cakes because of their low moisture content which
ensures that they are free from microbial spoilage and -onfer a long shelf life on the
product (Wade 1988).

Composite flours have been used extensively in the production of baked goods.
Composite flour can be described as a mixture of several flours obtained from root, tuber,
cereal and legume, with or without the addition of wheat flour, which is created to satisfy
specific functional characteristics and nutrient composition (Olapade and Adeyemo

2014). The use of composite flours from cereals, legumes and tubers for cookie

production is therefore expected to enhance the utilization of local crops as raw materials
and improve the nutritive quality of cookies.

Food staples as well as roots and tubers can be sources of composite flours. Food
staples refer to rice and other staples including white corn, root crops, and plantain. Since
there is a need to lower the demand for rice in the country, food staples diversification or
the use of alternatives to rice which include white corn, sweet potato, cassava, banana,
taro and adlai is being promoted (Department of Agriculture 2012).

Next to rice, corn (Zea mays L.) comes as the second most important crop in the
Philippines. Corn production is about 7.38 million metric tons (BAS 2013). It is
considered one of the staple foods, particularly in the Visayas and Mindanao. It is vital in
the advancement of livestock and poultry industries, with 60 % of its total production
yield used as feed and the remaining 40 % used as food and other products. As a food, the
whole grain, either mature or immature, may be used. It may be processed by dry milling
techniques to give a relatively large number of intermediary products, such as maize
grits, maize meal, maize flour and flaking grits. These materials in turn have a great

number of applications in a large variety of foods.

The general varieties of corn planted in the Philippines are yellow and white. Most of
the variety of yellow corn is intended for industrial use such as feeds and raw materials
for industrial products. It contains yellow fat which is favored as feeds over white corn
because it gives a good color to poultry and livestock meat. White corn, on the other

hand, is commonly referred to as the poor man’s rice. It is the preferred variety in the

country for food because of its taste and eating quality. 1.1 places where rice is the main

staple, white corn is consumed as vegetable or snacks.

One variety grown locally is the high-lysine and tryptophan corn known as Quality
Protein Maize (QPM). QPM is a new corn variety wherein the quantity of its protein is
enhanced compared to local varieties (Nagares et al. 2011). The Institute of Plant
Breeding (IPB) - UPLB is propagating the Obatanpa-x-Lagkitan wherein Obatanpa, a
white QPM was combined with the desirable characteristics of glutinous rice, Los Bafios

Lagkitan.

Roots and tubers are plants yielding starchy roots, tubers, rhizomes, corms and stems.
These crops include cassava, sweet potato, yams and aroids which are the second group
of cultivated species, after cereals, in tropical countries. One type of taro is the giant
swamp taro [Cyrtosperma merkusii (Hassk.) Schott.], commonly known as “galiang” in
the Bicol region or “palauan” or “palau” in the Visayas. It is the largest in the Aroideae
family that yields an edible corm. The species is grown in Indonesia, the Philippines and
Papua New Guinea among others. It is considered as a major crop in most atolls and low

islands of the Pacific but it is a minor crop today in the high islands of the Pacific.

Giant swamp taro has traditionally been an important emergency crop in times of
natural disaster and food scarcity. Giant swamp taro corms were found to contain
substantial amounts of carotenoid concentrations as well as zinc, iron and calcium

(Englberger et al. 2008). As other taro varieties, giant swamp taro tubers are potential

sources of flour and industrial starch that has not yet been utilized (Aboubakar et al.

2008)

Little attention has been given to giant swamp taro in contrast to other root crops. It is
considered as an underutilized agricultural crop because of its low acceptability of some
known preparations (Pahila et al. 2013). However, utilization potentials are yet to be
explored. The utilization of taro could be increased by developing suitable processing

technology and securing consumer acceptance (Ikpeme-Emmanuel et al. 2009).

In order to respond to the promotion of other staples as alternative for rice as well as
to address the need for disaster food in the form of ready-to-eat foods, this study will be
focused on the utilization of commodities such as corn and giant swamp taro into cookies

that is safe and nutrient dense.

Objectives

The general objective of this study was to produce vitamin A - , iron - and zinc —
dense cookies from Obatanpa—x—Lagkitan (Zea mays L. ‘Los Bafios lagkitan’) and giant
swamp taro [Cyrtosperma merkusii (Hassk.) Schott.] flours.

Specifically, the study aimed to:

1. evaluate the sensory attributes and acceptability of cookies;

2. measure proximate composition (moisture, crude fat, crude protein, crude fiber
and total ash) and carbohydrate profile (total starch, amylose content, dietary
fiber) of giant swamp taro flour, corn flour and most acceptable cookies;

3. measure lysine, tryptophan, iron, zinc, calcium and vitamin A present in giant
swamp taro flour, corn flour and most acceptable cookies;

4. determine the storage stability of the most acceptable cookies (length of storage,
water activity, microbial content), and

5. correlate between and among the storage stability, sensory characteristics and

acceptability of cookies.

Date and Place of the Study

The study was conducted from July to October 2015 in the Bioassay Analytical
Laboratory of the Institute of Human Nutrition and Food (IHNF) at the University of the

Philippines Los Bafios (UPLB), Laguna.

Scope and Limitation of the Study

The study only investigated the IPB Obatanpa-x-Lagkitan corn and giant swamp taro
flours and only the cookies that were found to be the most acceptable and cookies made
from 100 % giant swamp taro flour and 100% OxL corn flour were further analyzed for

its nutrient and microbiological qualities. Cookies were produced at laboratory scale

only. Water activity of the cookie samples were tested during the initial and final week

only.

REVIEW OF LITERATURE

Corn (Zea mays L.)

Corn or maize is one of the most important cereal crops produced for human
consumption in many parts of the world together with wheat and rice. It is grown
worldwide and has a remarkable productive potential. It has a major influence on the

global use of land, human diet and the quality of human lives.

Botanical Description

Botanically, corn belongs to the grass family (Gramineae) and is a tall annual plant
with au extensive fibrous root system. It has an erect, solid stem. Its height varies widely,
some dwarf varieties being little more than 60 cm (2 ft) tall at maturity, whereas other
types may reach heights of 6 m (20 ft) or more. The average height is 2.4 m (8 ft). The
leaves, which grow alternately, are long and narrow.

Corn is a cross pollinating species, with the female (ear) and male (tassel) flowers in
separate places on the plant. The grain develops in the ears, or cobs, often one on each
stalk, The ear is enclosed in modified leaves called husks. The individual silk fibers that
protrude from the tip of the ear are the elongated styles, each attached to an individual

ovary. Pollen from the tassels is carried by the wind and falls onto the silk, where it

germinates and grows down through the silk until it reaches the ovary. Each fertilized
ovary grows and develops into a kernel. Each ear has about 300 to 1000 kernels,
weighing between 190 and 300 g per 1000 kernels, in a variable number of rows. Weight
depends on genetic, environmental and cultural practices. Grain makes up about 42
percen! of the dry weight of the plant. The kernels are often white or yellow in color,
although black, red and mixture of colors are also found. There are a number of grain
types, distinguished by differences in the chemical compounds deposited or stored in the
kernel (FAO 1992).

The maize kernel, like that of other cereal grains, includes pericarp (6%), endosperm
(82%) and germ (12%). The main structural component of the endosperm is starch, a
complex carbohydrate that constitutes on an average 71% of the grain and is a source of
concentrated energy. Bulk of the proteins in a mature maize kernel is in the endosperm
and germ; but, the germ protein is superior in both quantity and quality. The endosperm
of maize contains a group of four structurally distinct alcohol-soluble proteins called
‘zeins’ which are more abundant in the endosperm t-1n in the embryo. They form
accretions called protein bodies in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of maize endosperm
cells. In normal maize genotypes, zeins usually account for 50 to 70% of the endosperm
protein and are characterized by a high content of glutamine, leucine and proline.

However, zeins are essentially devoid of lysine and tryptophan (Prasanna et al. 2001).

Quality Protein Maize (QPM)

The discovery of the Quality protein maize (QPM) varieties with Opaque-2 mutant
gene by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in 1964
containing about twice the levels of lysine and tryptophan and 10% higher grain yield
than the most modern varieties of tropical maize, brought a great hope in the effort of its
improvement as human and animal nutrition (Akande and Lamidi 2006). High level of
these two amino acids enhances manufacture of complete proteins in the body.

Quality Protein Maize has some characteristics diffe: “nt from the original high lysine
soft opaque maize cultivars. It is distinct as it is no more opaque and is indistinguishable
from normal endosperm of maize types. Moreover unlike soft opaque, QPM has been
developed using a combined interaction of opaque gene and the genetic modifiers while
still maintaining advanced quality protein (Prasanna et al. 2001). On the other hand,
QPM has exactly the same qualities as normal maize in grain texture, taste, color,

tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses as well as high yield (Sofi et al. 2009).

Nutritional Value of Quality Protein Maize (QPM)

The low nutritive value of maize can be corrected in improved genetically QPM.

QPM holds superior nutritional and biological value and is essentially interchangeable

with normal maize in cultivation and kernel phenotype (Prasanna et al. 2001). It differs


from common maize in the weight distribution of the five protein fraction — albumin,
globulins, non-protein nitrogen, prolamines and glutelin, respectively (FAO 1992).

QPM has about twice the lysine and tryptophan content of the normal maize. It has
also a much lower ratio of leucine to isoleucine than the normal maize, which is
considered beneficial for the production of niacin (Miko et al. 2001). It has a biological
nutritional value of 40% of that of milk (Bressani 1992). It can also be calculated that the
Net Protein Utilization (NPU), which is the product of digestibility and biologic value, is
about 40% for normal maize, and 65% for QPM. It is important to remember that normal
and QPM contain on average equal protein content (generally 8-12%). It is the protein
quality which differs between them (Miko et al. 2001).

Table 1 shows the nutrient composition of IPB Var 6, a quality protein maize variety
developed by the Institute of Plant Breeding, College of Agriculture in 2006 (Nagares et

al. 2011).

Quality Protein Maize is an improved variety of maize which contains higher amount
of lysine and tryptophan with lower amount of leucine and isoleucine in the endosperm
than those contained in normal maize. Such balanced combination of amino acids in the
endosperm results into its higher biological value ensuring more availability of protein to
human and animal than normal maize or even all cereals ind pulses. This initially led to
the release of an open-pollinated variety, a medium maturing QPM variety Obatanpa and
Los Bafios Lagkitan (Zea mays L.) also known as Philippine Glutinous Composite 2, was
originally developed by the Department of Agronomy, College of Agriculture, UPLB and
was approved for release in 1976 by the Philippine Seed Board (PSB), now known as the
National Seed Industry (NSIC). Los Banos Lagkitan contains the mutant waxy gene

(WX), which is responsible for the glutinous character and has ivory-white kernels.

Giant Swamp Taro [Cyrtosperma merkusii (Hassk.) Schott.]

Giant swamp taro is the dominant aroid that belongs .o the family Araceae. It is the
largest of the root crop plants known collectively as Taro, which are cultivated
throughout Southeast Asia and the Pacific.

In the Philippines, the edible aroids that have food and other uses to a considerable
number of people are taro (Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott), yautia (Xanthosoma
sagittifolium (L.) Schott.), giant taro (Alocasia macrorrhiza (L.) Schott.) swamp taro
(Cyrtosperma merkusii (Hassk.) Schott.) and elephant foot yam (Amorphophallus

campanulatus (Roxb.) Bl.). Among these, taro is the most socio-economically important


and widely distributed. The rest of the edible aroids, known as minor aroids, in contrast
with taro and yautia which are the major aroids, are confined only to certain areas of the
Philippines where they are grown as insurance crops to provide food during time of

emergency like after typhoons, floods, etc. (Pardales 1997).

Botanical Description

The plant may reach a height of 4 to 5 meters, with leaves and roots much larger than
Colocasia esculenta. The leaves are large, reaching a length of 1 meter, erect, and
saggitate to hastate in shape with two long, acute basal lobes. Petioles are large,
sometimes with prickles, spiny toward the base and reaching 3 meters in length in some
varieties (Pursglove 1975). Cataphylls (reduced leaves) are found on the underside of the
leaf in some varieties. The spathe is thick, yellowish with green veins while the spadix is

yellow to orange (Smith 1979).


Fig.1. Giant swamp taro plant

Unlike the other varieties of taro such as taro, giant taro and which are grown on dry
land, giant swamp taro is grown in fresh water marshes and swampy areas. It is a water
loving plant (hydrophyte) adapted to fresh to brackish water conditions in coastal
marshes, natural and man-made swamps, and pit depressions. Deep soils are preferable,
as local taro experts stress that giant swamp taro grows both upward and downward in
contrast to Colocasia taro which grows upward only (Englberger 2009). However, it is
not suitable for growing in upland or rainfed conditions. It exhibits some shade tolerance
and is considered mildly tolerant of saline growing conditions compared to other taro

species. Few, if any studies, have focused on the soil tolerances of giant swamp taro.


Giant swamp taro is normally left to grow much by. emselves after planting. Often,
it is only when there is need for them that the plants are visited. Generally, for the edible
aroids the order of intensity of cultural management is taro > yautia > elephant foot yam

> giant taro > giant swamp taro (Pardales 1997).

Giant swamp taro is a slow growing crop. It requires a long time before harvesting,
usually three years, depending on the variety. Some can take up to 15 years to mature.
Generally, the tubers produced weigh between | and 5 kg. It is harvested in small patches

for its underground tubers called corms which can reach weights of 80 kg or more.

Postharvest Handling and Processing

Like many root crops, giant swamp taro must be cooked to be edible. Most people
consider Cyrtosperma coarse-textured, compared to Colocasia, giving a gritty feeling in
the mouth but it is free of the irritating or itchy quality often found with other taro (Murai

et al. 1958).

Giant swamp taro is a root crop staple that is prepared by boiling or grinding, roasted,
mashed or grated and combined with other starches for eating. In a number of recipes,

coconut cream is used and then it is baked.

The corm needs to be eaten within two to three days of harvesting. However, corms

can be stored in moist ground for up to 6 months. A tuber or corm not cooked


immediately after harvesting is said to form bitter spots. These spots are cut out during

the peeling process prior to cooking (Untaman 1982).

The implication for storage of corms was studied. Comparisons of frozen and
dehydrated samples showed that frozen samples had a higher concentration of carotenes
than dehydrated samples. This showed that dehydration of samples is not a good method
to use for maintaining the maximum carotenoid concentrations of the fresh corms

(Englberger et al. 2008).

In Benguet, Philippines, starches were extracted from various roots, corms and tubers,
including giant swamp taro, cassava, sweet potato, and arrowroot. These starches were
then mixed with wheat flour at 25% and 50% formulations. Noodles made at the 25%
formulation gave excellent results. The dough mixture was moderately soft, easily hand
extruded and gave firm noodle strength during cookin. and drying (Englberger et al.

2008).

Nutritional Composition

Englberger et al. (2008) have advocated further research on the carotenoid nutrient
and fiber content of giant swamp taro cultivars, their bioavailability, and implications for
the health of Pacific islanders. There are many Cyrtosperma cultivars, but few have been

analyzed for nutrient content.


Samples were collected in the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of
Palau, assessed for corm flesh color and other attributes, and analyzed for carotenoids (B-
and a-carotene, B-cryptoxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, and lycopene) and minerals
(including iron, zinc, and calcium). Of 34 cultivars analyzed, B-carotene concentrations
varied from 50 to 4486 g/100g. Yellow-fleshed cultivars generally contained higher
carotenoid concentrations. Of the ten cultivars analyzed for mineral content (wet weight
basis), substantial concentrations of zinc (5.4-46.1 mg/110g), iron (0.3-0.8 mg/100g) and
calcium (121-305 mg/100g) were found. All cultivars were acceptable for taste and
production factors. These carotenoid- and mineral-rich cultivars should be considered for

promotion for potential health benefits.

All 11 cultivars with yellow-colored corms had high B-carotene content. The two
cultivars with creamy-colored corms, which were selected for analysis for purposes of
comparison, had a low B-carotene content. Thus, yellow-colored corms consistently had
higher carotenoid content, but there were no clear differences in color gradation between
taro corms with high and medium carotenoid levels. Informants reported that the corm

color of a cultivar varies according to the soil and location (Englberger et al. 2003).

Table 2 shows the nutrient compusition of giant sw .mp taro corms based on their
color, such as unspecified color, white or cream-colored and yellow colored corms

(Dignan et al. 2004).

Cookies

Biscuits are small baked products made principally from flour, sugar and fat (Manley
1998). The word "biscuit" is of French origin and means "twice cooked". Nowadays,
most biscuits are baked only once (Lallemand Inc 2000). Biscuits typically have a
moisture content of less than 4% and have a long shelf life of six months or more
(Manley 1998).

Composite flours are advantageous in the sense that inherent deficiencies of essential
amino acids in wheat flour (lysine, tryptophan and th.eonine) are supplemented from
other sources (Olapade and Adeyemo 2014). Cookies have been suggested as a better use
of composite flour than bread due to their ready-to-eat form, wide consumption,

relatively long shelf life and good eating quality (McWatters et al. 2003).


Combining IR 72 rice variety and QPM white com grits at a 70:30 ratio can be
utilized as a staple food owing to its improved nutritional and sensory qualities. The
addition of QPM white com grits to IR 72 rice variety iucreased the amount of protein,
lysine, tryptophan, fat, ash, starch, amylose and total fiber content of the rice-com
composites (rice and com combination). Based from the 7-point Hedonic rating scale for
evaluation, all the rice-com composites were considered acceptable in terms of color,
odor, flavor, cohesiveness and texture (Nagares et al. 2011).

The nutritional value, phytochemical components and antinutrient contents of taro
corm and its products were studied. Processing taro corm significantly affected its
proximate composition, mineral content, phytochemical components and antinutrient
(oxalate and phytate) contents. There was a significant reduction in the proximate
composition, mineral content, phytochemical components and antinutrient contents when
taro corms were made into powder ard were further dec"zased when processed into taro
noodles and cookies. Exposure to high temperature during processing could have greatly
affected the reduction in nutrient and phytochemical as well as antinutrient contents of
the samples (Alcantara et al. 2013).

A fortified cookie was developed from dehydrated swamp taro combined with all-
purpose enriched wheat flour. The three treatments were nfortified swamp taro (ST)
cookie, ST cookie with dehydrated moringa (Moringa oleifera) leaves and ST cookie
with dehydrated moringa leaves and squash (Cucurbita moschata). The study showed
that the moisture, protein, crude fiber, and soluble carbohydrate contents of the cookies

with fortifications did not significantly differ from the unfortified cookies but the fat,


total mineral content and the vitamin A content of the fortified cookies were significantly
higher than the unfortified cookies. The cookies developed using dehydrated swamp taro
with moringa and squash can be described as nutritious in terms of protein content (11 %)
with high calorie value from crude fat (16.5 — 18 %) and high soluble carbohydrate (61.5
— 63.2 %). Based on the proximate composition of the cookies, 15 cookies at 13.3
g/cookie could provide about 22 g protein equivalent to one third of the recommended
dietary allowance (RDA) for protein, 34 — 36 g fat and 122-126 g carbohydrate
equivalent to one half of the RDA for fat and carbohydrate and >100 % of the vitamin A
daily requirement in accordance with the estimated 2000-calorie RDA of a 50-kg normal
adult. After sensory evaluation using the 9-point hedonic scale, the fortified cookies were
described to be highly acceptable in terms of appearance and moderately acceptable in

terms of texture and flavor (Pahila et al. 2013).

Iron

Iron is one of the most important trace elements required. It is essential for many
proteins and enzymes that maintain good health and is involved in many metabolic
reactions and the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. It is also involved in the
proper functioning of the liver and plays a role in improving the immune activity by
protecting the body against the harmful actions of free radicals. Iron is widely distributed
throughout the body. The total iron content varies with age, sex, nutrition, and state of

health. A normal adult man is estimated to contain 4.5 grams of iron.


Because of its oxidation-reduction (redox) properties, iron has a role in the blood and
respiratory transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide and it is an active component of the
cytochromes (enzymes) involved in the processes of cellular respiration and energy
(ATP) generation. Iron also seems to be involved in immune function and cognitive
performance (Mahan and Escott-Stump 2004).

The recommended intake for iron is based on the amount of dietary iron needed to
meet absorbed iron requirements (Table 3). This would correspond to the amount needed
to cover basal losses plus growth for children and menstrual losses for women of

reproductive age, adjusted for bioavailability of iron in typical complete meals consumed.

Zinc

Zinc is a constituent of over 300 metalloenzymes that participate in carbohydrate,
lipid and protein metabolism, nucleic acid synthesis and degradation. It is an essential
trace element for optimal human growth and development, normal reproduction, immune
and sensory function, antioxidant protection, the stabilization of membranes and gene
expression (Gibson 2006).

The potential impact of zinc deficiency on infant, child, and maternal health in
developing countries was not recognized by the United Nations until 1997, when zinc
was included among the micronutrient deficiencies listed as a priority in the Third Report
on the World Nutrition Situation (ACC/SCN 1997). Zin deficiency is largely related to
inadequate intake or absorption of zinc from the diet, although excess losses of zinc
during diarrhea may also contribute (Gibson 1994). Zinc supplementation can reduce
morbidity from a number of common childhood infections, especially diarrhea,
pneumonia, and possibly malaria. In addition, zinc deficiency is an important cause of
stunting (Umeta et al. 2000).

The distinction between intake and absorption is important, because although some
intakes of zinc may be acceptable, the levels of inhibitors (e.g. fiber and phytates) in the
diet may mean that inadequate amounts of zinc are absorbed. For this reason, zinc
requirements for dietary intake are adjusted upward for populations in which animal
products, the best sources of zinc, are limited, and in which plant sources of zinc are

similarly high in phytates. Because zinc is not well conserved in the body and because


zinc deficiency is directly related to dietary zinc intake, an indirect approach to quantify
the prevalence of zinc deficiency would be to examine the adequacy of zinc in the diet in
various regions throughout the world (Alcantara et al. 2012). In the Philippines, the zinc
requirement for adults (Table 4) is based on the intake that will meet the daily absorbed
zinc requirements of 0.072 and 0.059 mg/kg for adult males and females, respectively
and adjusted for bioavailability of 30% following the recommendation of FAO/WHO

(PDRI 2015).

Calcium

Calcium is the fifth most abundant element in the body with >99 % residing in the
skeleton as hydroxyapatite, a complex calcium phosphate molecule while the remaining
1% of calcium is in the blood and extracellular fluids and within the cells of all tissues,
where it regulates many important metabolic functions (Mahan and Escott-Stump 2004).
In the bones, calcium serves two main purposes: it -rovides skeletal strength and,
concurrently, provides a dynamic store to maintain the intra- and extracellular calcium
pools (Peacock 2010). This mineral supplies the strength to bones that support
locomotion, but it also serves as a reservoir to maintain serum calcium levels (Weaver
and Peacock 2011). It also contributes to the electrical potential of cell membranes and is
involved in many fundamental processes, including DNA synthesis, enzyme activity,
photo- and chemosensory transduction, neurotransmitter release, membrane permeability
and intercellular communication. On the cellular level, calcium is used to regulate the
permeability and electrical properties of biological membranes such as cell walls, which
in turn control muscle and nerve functions, glandular secretions, and blood vessel dilation

Vitamin A

Since roots and tubers are very low in lipid they are not in themselves rich sources of
fat-soluble vitamins. However, provitamin A is present as the pigment beta-carotene in
the leaves of root crops, some of which are edible. Most roots and tubers contain only
negligible amounts of beta carotenes with the exception of selected varieties of sweet
potato. Deep colored varieties are richer in carotenes than white cultivars (FAO 1990).

Beta-carotene is the main safe dietary source of vitamin A which is essential for

normal growth and development, immune system function, and vision. Beta-carotene has


antioxidant properties that can help neutralize free radicals — reactive oxygen molecules
potentially damaging lipids in cell membranes and genetic material, which may lead to
the de elopment of cardiovascular disease and cancer (Pavia and Russel 1999).

The recommended intake levels for vitamin A correspond to the safe levels of intake
based on the average amounts of vitamin A required to maintain a given body-pool size

in well-nourished individuals (Table 6).

Dietary Fiber

Dietary fiber comes from the family of carbohydrates, a non-starch polysaccharide,
not digested in the small intestine but may be fermented in the colon into short chain fatty
acids (SCFA) such as acetate, propionate and butyrate. SCFA contributes 1.5— 2.0 kcal/g
dietary fiber (Roberfroid 1997). It enhances water absorption in the colon, thus prevent
constipation. Propionate has been shown to inhibit the activity of the enzyme HMG CoA
reductase, the limiting enzyme for cholesterol synthesis. Dietary fiber has the ability to
bind with bile acids and prevents its reabsorption in the liver thus, inhibit cholesterol
synthesis. Butyrate enhances cell differentiation thus preventing tumor formation in the
colon (Jenkins et al. 1982).

The viscose and fibrous structure of dietary fiber can control the release of glucose
with time in the blood, thus helping in the proper control and management of diabetes
mellitus and obesity. Glycemic index, a classification of food based on their blood
glucose response relative to a starchy food e.g. white bread, or standard glucose solution,
has been proposed as a therapeutic principle for diabetes mellitus by slowing
carbohydrate absorption. Low glycemic index food e.g. high dietary fiber food, has been
shown to reduce post — prandial blood glucose and insulin responses and improve the
overall blood glucose and lipid concentrations in normal subjects and patients with
diabetes mellitus (Collier et al. 1988).

Pure QPM corn grits were found to have lower glycemic response compared to

milled rice and the rice-corn grits mixture, which may be related in part to differences in


their dietary fiber composition and physicochemical characteristics. Pure QPM corn grits
may be more health beneficial food for diabetic and hyperlipidemic individuals
(Panlasigui et al. 2010). A daily intake of 20 to 25 g of total dietary fiber for adults is

recommended (Table 7).

Lysine and Tryptophan

Lysine and tryptophan are two of the essential amiuo acids needed for the proper
growth and development of animals (monogastric) including humans. Lysine is the most

limiting amino acid in corn endosperm and other cereal grains. Similarly, tryptophan is


also a limiting amino acid in corn endosperm. In screening large number of pedigrees,
tryptophan level usually serve as basis for selecting promising high protein quality corn
(Nujiez-Ragus 1975).

Lysine is essential for proper growth and it plays in the production of carnitine, a
nutrient responsible for converting fatty acids into energy and helps to lower cholesterol.
Furthermore, lysine helps the body to absorb calcium and portrays a very important role
in the formation of collagen, a substance essential for bones and connective tissues.

On the other hand, tryptophan has an important role in the production of nervous
system messengers, especially those related to relaxation, restfulness and sleep. It also
prevents niacin deficiency and raise serotonin levels, a neurotransmitter that helps the
body regulate appetite, sleep patterns and mood.

The amount of lysine needed depends on the protein intake. The recommended amino
acid scoring pattern for proteins for individuals aged | year and older and all other age
groups for lysine is 51 mg/g protein while 7 mg/g protein for tryptophan (Institute of

Medicine — Food and Nutrition Board, IOM — FNB 2002).

Sensory Evaluation

Food quality refers to textural and sensory properties. The texture of a product is
required to define food’s total physical characteristics that are evaluated by resistance to
mastication and accompanying sensations of total mouth feel. Preliminary evaluation of

texture may be consciously or unconsciously made from visual appearance of the food


(roughness or stratification, orientation etc.) or by actually tearing apart, a product to see
its structural fabrication. It may be evaluated by more scientific means using
instrumentation obtaining objectively some index, which co-relates with the mastication

process.

Shelf Life

According to Kramer and Twigg (1968), food quality is defined as the collection of
properties where each parameter that has been differentiated influences the degree of
acceptability of the food by the consumer or user. Each food product has its own
particular length of time after its production to retain acceptable sensory and safety
qualities under given conditions, thus the term “shelf-life” (Taoukis et al. 1997).

Shelf-life is a complex determination process that may be categorized into
microbiological, chemical and organoleptic (sensory) analysis (VTFST 2009). It is a vast
concept that may come from an analytical determination of different deterioration
parameters as a subjective decision of a consumer. These objective measures can identify
the time in which a measured property reaches the predetermined value, which is the
shelf-life. Objective measures are descriptors that may be used to monitor deterioration.
Some of which are the product’s Vitamin C content, chlorophyll (and other pigments),
color, protein solubility, textural change, oxidation level, amine production, moisture

content (MC), pH, gas composition, and etc. Also, there are different subjective measures


which determine the time for a consumer response to be elicited that is sensory shelf-life
analysis (Reid et al. 2003).

The shelf life of a food can be defined as the period it will retain an acceptable level
of eating quality, from a safety and sensory point of view (Singh & Cadwallader 2002).
Consequently, storage stability or the shelf-life of baked products could be defined as
maintenance of the sensory and physical characteristics associated with freshness such as
crumb tenderness, compressibility and moistness by preventing alteration associated with
staling during storage (Baixauli et al. 2008).

Accelerated shelf life testing (ASLT) is the most frequently used methodology in
estimating shelf life. The objective is to store the finished product/package combination
under abuse condition, examine the product periodically until the end of shelf life occurs,
and then use this data to project shelf life under true distribution conditions.

On the other hand, total plate count evaluates a food product’s total growth of
microorganisms. It does not specifically isolate and identify the microorganisms growing
but it provides sufficient information regarding a food’s acceptability in terms of
microbial contamination by enumeration and detection (USFDA 2011). It is important
because it gives an indication of the hygienic properties of the food. It indicates
effectiveness and efficiency of the food chain process and gives information regarding
shelf life and organoleptic changes during storage of the food stuff (Batool et al. 2012).
Visual and textural changes, increased acidity and off-flavors may be negative effects of
microbial growth (Robertson 2010). Hence, microbial load of the product is also an

indicator of quality and shelf life.


Water Activity

Water activity (ay) is defined by the ratio of the water vapor pressure of food
substrate to the vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature: ay = p/po, where p
is the vapor pressure of the solution and po is the vapor pressure of the solvent (usually
water). It describes a thermodynamic energy property of water in the food, and in part,

water acts as a solvent and participates in chemical reactions (Labuza 1977).

Microorganisms are dependent on the water available in foods for utilization, a reason
why ay is a parameter in terms of food safety. Products prepared from flour are
deteriorated by mold and bacteria. Each microorganism has its own range of water
activity for growth under a given environmental conditic ‘s. Therefore an unfavorable ay
of food would result in the reduction of growth rate and delay in initiation of growth of

spores (Frazier and Westhoff 1978).

The water activity of most fresh foods is above 0.99. In general, bacteria require
higher values of ay for growth than fungi, with Gram-negative bacteria having higher
requirements than Gram positives. Most spoilage bacteria do not grow below ay = 0.91,
whereas spoilage molds can grow as low as 0.80. With respect to food-poisoning
bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus can grow as low as 0.86, whereas Clostridium botulinum
does not grow below 0.94. Just as yeasts and molds grow over a wider pH range than
bacteria, the same is true for ay. The lowest reported value for foodborne bacteria is 0.75

for halophiles (literally, “salt-loving”), whereas xerop' ilic (‘“dry-loving”) molds and


osmophilic (preferring high osmotic pressures) yeasts have been reported to grow at ay
values of 0.65 and 0.61, respectively. When salt is employed to control ay, an extremely
high level is necessary to achieve ay values below 0.80 (Jay et al. 2005).

Water activity influences not only microbial spoilage but also chemical and
enzymatic reactivity (Figure 2). Water activity influences nonenzymatic browning, lipid
oxidation, degradation of vitamins and other nutrients, enzymatic reactions, protein
denaturation, starch gelatinization and starch retrogradation. Typically, as the water
activity level is lowered, the rate of chemical degradative reactions decreases (Nollet

2004).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Raw Materials

The Obatanpa-x-Lagkitan (OxL) corn flour was obtained from the Institute of Plant
Breeding. The giant swamp taro corm was purchased from a local farmer in Goa,
Camarines Sur and was authenticated at the Museum of Natural History, UPLB. Dry
milling process was done at the Institute of Food Science and Technology (IFST) of the
College of Agriculture, UPLB to produce giant swamp taro flour. Other ingredients that

were used in cookie production were obtained from the local market.

Preparation of Giant Swamp Taro Flour

Different physical treatments were involved in the preparation of giant swamp taro

flour (Figure 3). The raw corm of giant swamp taro was washed, peeled, grated, soaked

overnight, blanched, dried and milled (Blase 2011) (Appendix Figures).

Preparation of Cookies

Cookies were prepared and modified from the formula of Alcantara et al. 2013
(Appendix A). The ingredients used were the corn and taro composite flours, margarine,
granulated sugar, egg, vanilla, salt, and baking powder. Margarine and sugar were
creamed together using an electric mixer at medium speed. Vanilla was then added to the
creamed mixture. Slightly beaten eggs were added and mixed. Dry ingredients such as
the corn and giant swamp taro composite flour, baking powder and salt were then mixed
and added to the creamed mixture where they were all beaten in low speed until it
became a uniform, smooth paste. One half tablespoon of dough was dropped and
flattened in a greased baking pan. Baking was carried out at 375°F (190°C) for 15

minutes. Cookie samples were then removed from the ..n and cooled on racks at room


temperature for 15 minutes. Cookies were stored in metalized aluminum foil pouches
made from oriented polypropylene / metalized polyethy'ene terephthelate / polyethylene
(OPP/VMPET/PE) until needed (Figure 4).

The 11 proportions of cookies had undergone sensory evaluation. The composite
flours, the most acceptable cookies as well as the 100 % OxL corn flour cookies and 100
% giant swamp taro cookies were selected and subjected to chemical analyses and

storage studies. Results were analyzed and data were interpreted (Figure 5).

Chemical Analyses

The OxL corn flour, giant swamp taro flour, 100 % JxL corn cookies, 100 % giant
swamp taro cookies and the 90:10 GST:OxL cookies were subjected to chemical tests
and storage stability tests. Means were expressed in dry weight basis. All the analyses

were carried out in triplicate.

Proximate Composition and Energy Content

Flours and cookies were analyzed for moisture, crude protein, ash, crude fat and
crude fiber following the standard methods of Association of Official Analytical
Chemists (AOAC 1990). The carbohydrate (expressed as nitrogen free extract, NFE) was
obtained by difference (% NFE = 100 - (% Moisture 4 % Crude Protein + % Ash + %
Crude Fiber + % Crude Fat) (Appendix B). The energy content in kcal/100g was
determined by adding percentages of crude fat, crude protein and carbohydrate after

multiplying by factors of 9, 4 and 4 respectively.

Carbohydrate Profile Analysis

Total starch analysis was determined by Anthrone method. Amylose content was

determined by the standard methods of AOAC (1990). Amylopectin content was

calculated by difference (% amylopectin = % starch - % amylose).


Total dietary fiber was determined using the procedure described by Sigma TDF-
100a and TDF-C10 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., U.S.A.), following the method

published by AOAC (1997).

B-carotene Determination

B-carotene content was determined using the method of Ishiwu et al. (2014). The B-

carotene values were used to calculate vitamin A contributed to the diet, expressed as

retinol equivalent (RE), where 12 1g B-carotene equated to | wg RE.

Mineral and Amino Acid Analyses

Iron and zinc contents of the flours and cookies were analyzed using the standard

analytical method for atomic absorption spectrophotometry while calcium content

determination followed the EDTA method as described by the AOAC (1990). Lysine and

tryptophan were also determined according to the method of AOAC (1990).

Sensory Evaluation

Sensory evaluation offers the opportunity to obtain a complete analysis of the

various properties of food as perceived by human sense. It is an important and best


method for evaluating new products developed which provide quality measure and
production control.

Cookies with different proportions of GST:OxL corn flour blends were subjected to
sensory evaluation a using a score card (Appendix C) with the seven point Hedonic scale
(I and 7 representing “dislike very much” and “like very much”, respectively) to assess
the color, aroma, texture, and flavor based on the degree of liking. The general
acceptability of the cookies was also evaluated. A panel of 30 judges, composed of male
and female college students, evaluated the prepared cookies to determine the most
acceptable product. The samples were coded with threc digit numbers and presented to
the panelists. The panelists were asked to rinse their mouths with water after every
sample and not to make comments during evaluation to prevent influencing other

panelists.

Storage Studies

For storage studies, the cookie samples were stored at ambient temperature of 30°C in
metalized aluminum foil pouch packaging (OPP/VMPET/PE) obtained from the
Industrial Technology Development Institute (ITDI-DOST). The products were then
analyzed for water activity at the begining and end oft! study. On the other hand, total
plate count and yeast and mold count were determined at one week interval (Day |, after

1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks and 4 weeks) for a period of one month.


Determination of Water Activity (ay)

The water activity was measured using the Novasina, a water activity measuring
system. Analyses were done in the DOST — Region IV-A (CALABARZON) Regional

Standards and Testing Laboratory.

Microbiological Analysis

Cookies were packed in aluminum foil pouch (OPP/VMPET/PE) at 30°C. Samples
were subjected for total plate count (TPC) and yeast and mold count. Analyses were done
at one week interval for a period of one month. TPC was determined using plate count
agar (PCA) after incubation for | to 2 days at 32°C. Yeast and mold count was estimated
with the use of acidified potato dextrose agar (PDA) after incubation at 32°C for 2 to 3
days. Colonies on plate were counted and reported as colony forming units/gram (CFU/g)

sample (BAM 1998).

Sensory Evaluation

The stored cookie samples were coded and presented to ten member panel of judges.
The panelists evaluated the color, aroma, texture, flavor and general acceptability using a
nine point Hedonic scale (Appendix C), where 9 indic-tes extremely like while 1 for

extremely dislike, for a period of one month with one week interval.


Computation of Nutritional Value

The nutritional value of corn flour, giant swamp taro flour and cookies was computed
for its contribution to the recommended energy/nutrient intake for Filipinos (% REI or %
RNI) for energy, protein, zinc, iron, calcium and vitam'n A. This is to determine if the
flours and processed cookies will be good sources of these nutrients for a particular age
group using the formula:

Nutrient content of food per 100g
YREL/% RN] = wveeneeeseeeeeeeeeeeccecccec cee eeeeennese x 100
REI/ RNI for age

For a food to be considered a “source” of protein, it should be >10% of Nutrient
Reference Values (NRV) per 100 grams, while it should be >20% of NRV per 100 grams
to be considered a “high source”. On the other hand, for a food to be considered a
“source” of vitamins, minerals and energy, it should be >15% of NRV per 100 grams,
while it should be >30% of NRV per 100 grams to be considered a “high source”. A food
to be considered “source” of dietary fiber, is should have 3 g/100 g or 1.5 g /100 kcal or
10 % of daily reference value/serving whereas “high source” if food has 6 g/100 g or 3 g
/100 kcal or 20 % of daily reference value/serving (Codex Alimentarius 2007). The
REVRNI was used in this study, which is one of the components of 2015 Philippine
Dietary Reference Intakes (PDRI), will represent the Nutrient Reference Values (NRV)

since it is the dietary standards used in the Philippines.


Statistical Analysis

Data that was gathered from the sensory evaluation was subjected to Friedman
ANOVA on Ranks. Data from chemical and microbiological analyses were subjected to
ANOVA and means were separated using Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference (HSD)
test. Spearman’s rho rank correlation analysis was used to measure the strength of

association among the different variables.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Preliminary Screening

Eleven proportions from GST:OxL corn flour blends (100:0, 90:10, 80:20, 70:30,
60:40, 50:50, 40:60, 30:70, 20:80, 10:90 and 0:100) were made into cookies. All of the
flour blends have achieved the desired consistency for cookies, hence, were subjected to
sensory evaluation.

Sensory attributes of the cookies were evaluated using the seven-point Hedonic scale
based on the color, aroma, texture, flavor, and general acceptability. The results of the
sensory evaluation showed that the 90:10 GST:Oxl corn cookies were the most
acceptable as judged by 30 panel composed of students (Table 9).

Color is an important factor that affects the food’s attractiveness. Appearance of the
food is the first indicator of its acceptability. The sensory scores for color of the cookies
were rated as liked moderately. Results revealed that there were no significant differences
observed for color among the samples. The white color associated with the corn flour and
the brown color associated with the giant swamp taro flour did not have a significant
effect.

In terms of texture, all the cookies were not significantly different with each other.
Softer and chewy texture was noted in cookies with higher amounts of OxL corn flour.

Flour for cookies should be more extensible but less springy such that when masticated,

such biscuits would be crispy (Kent 1985). The 40:60 GST:OxL corn cookies were rated
as liked moderately but not significantly different from the other cookie samples.

Aroma is another attribute that influences the acceptance of baked goods even before
they are tested. There were significant differences found in the aroma of the cookies. The
90:10 GST:OxL corn cookies was the most preferred while the 20:80 GST:OxL com
cookies was the least preferred.

Flavor is a sensory impression perceived by the sense of taste and smell. There were
significant differences found among the cookies in terms of the flavor. The flavor of the
cookies ranged from 5.03 to 6.31. The 90:10 GST:OxL corn cookies were the most

preferred in terms of flavor which were evaluated as liked moderately while 100 % OxL


cookies were the least preferred. A buttery flavor was noted that could have influenced to
the acceptability of cookies. The panelists also reported absence of irritation in the mouth
or throat during and after the sensory evaluation which implies that acridity has decreased
during the processing of giant swamp taro.

In general, all the 11 GST:OxL corn cookie flour blends were found acceptable.
However, the 90:10 GST: OxL corn cookies was liked moderately and the most
acceptable in terms of aroma and flavor. The pleasant aroma and buttery flavor of the

cookies have contributed to its overall appeal.

Proximate Composition

Moisture Content

Moisture content is a quality factor for preservation, convenience in packaging
transport, or shipping, and it also constitute an identity standard (Bradley 2000). Table 10
summarizes the proximate composition of OxL corn flour, giant swamp taro flour, OxL
corn cookies, giant swamp taro cookies and GST-OxL c«-rn cookies.

Giant swamp taro flour had higher moisture content at 5.38 % compared to OxL corn
flour at 3.28 %. The low moisture content of these flours was within the acceptable limit
of not more than 10 % for long storage of flour. On the other hand, the moisture content
of cookies ranged from 1.72 % to 3.17 %. GST cookies had the highest moisture content

among the three cookies followed by GST:OxL corn cookies and OxL corn cookies.


Results revealed that the moisture content of corn flour and giant swamp taro
decreased significantly when processed into cookies. This reduction in moisture content
of cookies was due to the application of higher temperature in baking which is 190°C as
compared to the 60°C used in drying which caused the loss of water from the food as
result of evaporation. When a food is placed in a hot oven, the low humidity of air in the
oven creates a moisture vapor pressure gradient, which causes the moisture at the surface
of the food to evaporate and this in turn creates movement of moisture from the interior

of the food to the surface (Tekle 2009).

*dry weight basis except moisture content

Total Ash

The ash content is an indication of the level of mineral contents present in the diet.
GST flour had higher ash content (2.65 %) compared to OxL flour (0.52 %). The ash
content of the processed cookies was lower than that of OxL corn flour and GST flour.
GST cookies had the highest ash content at 2.40 % followed by GST-OxL cookies at 1.76
% and OxL corn cookies at 0.41 %.

The reduction of the ash content when processed into cookies could have resulted
from baking at high temperature that caused either degradation of the minerals or

chemical changes like oxidation (Olajide et al. 2011). When organic matter is heated,


minerals present in both the organic and inorganic combinations are converted into
inorganic compounds which compose the ash. As the heating continued, some of the
mineral elements may be partly loss as volatile compounds (Jacobs 1972) contributing to

the reduction in the ash content.

Crude Fiber

Crude fiber is the sum of all those inorganic components of the plant cell membrane
and supporting structures which in chemical analysis of plant foodstuffs remain after
removal of crude protein, crude fat and nitrogen free extractives (Meyer 1960). Thus the
crude fiber should be composed of the cellulose, hemicelluloses and some materials that
encrust the cell walls such as lignins and pectic substances (Sujak et al. 2006).

GST flour had higher crude fiber (2.33 %) content than OxL corn flour (0.83 %). The
crude fiber content of the cookies was lower than those of the OxL corn and GST flours.
Among the cookies, GST cookies had the highest crude fiber content at 2.13 % while
OxL corn cookies had the lowest at 0.79 % (Table 10). Tuc results also showed that crude
fiber were significantly different among the flours and cookies. Processes involving heat
treatment may affect the fiber content in foods in different ways (FAO, 1990). Since
baking required higher temperature (190°C), it is possible that this caused the decrease in

fiber content when made into cookies.


Crude Protein

The OxL corn flour had higher crude protein (10.31 %) than giant swamp taro flour
(7.28 %). Among the cookies, OxL corn cookies had the highest crude protein content
(8.61 %) followed by GST-OxL cookies (7.33 %) whereas GST cookies (7.28 %) had the
lowest. Results showed that there was no significant difference in the crude protein of the
GST flour, GST-OxL corn cookies and GST cookies. However, crude protein of the OxL
corn flour and OxL corn cookies were significantly different.

The low crude protein of the OxL corn cookies could be due to the denaturation of the
secondary and tertiary structures of the protein which cc Id have been disrupted by heat

during baking.

Crude Fat

The OxL corn flour had higher crude fat (0.83 %) content than GST flour (0.70 %).
On the other hand, the OxL corn cookies exhibited the highest fat content (8.43 %)
followed by 90:10 GST-OxL corn cookies (7.63 %) and GST cookies (6.64 %).

The crude fat content of the cookies was higher than that of the pure OxL corn and
GST flours. This may have resulted from the incorporation of shortening in the cookies.
Cookies with too much fat content may be undesirable. from the standpoint of storage

stability, due to increased tendency to rancidity, leading to the development of unpleasant


and odorous compounds. As such, relatively low fat content is desirable in baked food

products.

Nitrogen Free Extracts

Carbohydrate content of the OxL corn flour was higher (85.02 %) than giant swamp
taro flour (84.23 %). Similarly, OxL corn cookies exhibited higher carbohydrate content
at 83.42 % than GST-OxL cookies with 82.38 % and GST cookies with 75.36 %
carbohydrate content. The addition of other ingredients such as egg and margarine could
have decreased the amount of carbohydrate hence the lower carbohydrate content of the

cookies than the OxL corn and GST flours.

Carbohydrate Profile

The OxL corn flour had the higher starch content at 84.06 % compared to giant
swamp taro flour at 80.97 %. The OxL corn flour and OxL corn cookies were
significantly different in terms of the starch content (Table 11). However, there was no
significant difference among GST flour and giant swamp taro-based cookies. OxL corn
cookies (82.46 %) had higher starch content among the cookies, followed by GST
cookies (81.21 %) and GST-OxL cookies (80.73 %).

Amylose content is significantly higher in OxL com flour at 23.55 % than that of

GST flour (21.95 %). Both OxL corn flour and GST flour were classified to have


intermediate amylose. Amylose tends to act as a restraint to gelatinization because it
diffuses out of the granules during swelling, making up the continuous phase (network)
outside the granules. It has been reported that waxy starches usually swell to a greater
extent than non-waxy starches (Varavinit et al. 2003). Consequently, OxL corn flour had
higher amylopectin content (60.52 %) than GST flour. The high amylopectin content of
OxL corn flour gives its waxy or glutinous character.

Among the cookies, GST cookies had the highest amylose content followed by GST-
OxL curn cookies and OxL corn cookies. GST cookies are classified to have intermediate
amylose while OxL corn cookies and GST-OxL cookies are classified as low amylose.
This can be noted on the firmer texture of GST cookies than OxL corn cookies. On the
other hand, OxL corn cookies had the highest amylopectin (65.78 %) while the GST
cookies had the least (58.47 %). The softer and chewier eating quality of the OxL corn

cookies as compared to 100 % GST cookies can be attributed to its high amylopectin.

Total Dietary Fiber

Dietary fiber are the edible parts of plants or arlogous carbohydrates that are
resistant to digestion and absorption in the small intestine, with partial fermentation in the
large intestine. These plant food materials include non-starch polysaccharides such as
celluloses, some hemi-celluloses, gums and pectin as well as resistant starches (DeVries
2001).

Giant swamp taro flour had higher total dietary fiber than OxL corn flour (2.49 % and
1.04 %, respectively). The GST cookies and GST flour had the highest dietary fiber
content at 2.53 % and 2.49 % but no significant differences were found between the two
(Table 12). The dietary fiber content of GST flour was recorded to be lower compared to
the reported dietary fiber content of other aroid flours such as taro (Colocasia esculenta)
flour at 8.24 % and cocoyam (Xanthosoma sagittifolium) flour at 5.19 % in the study of
Perez et al. (2007).

On the other hand, significant differences were found among OxL corn flour, corn
cookies and GST-OxL cookies. The dietary fiber of the cookies ranged from 1.11 — 2.53
%, It can be noted that the dietary fiber contents of all the cookies were within the
recommended range of not more than 5 g dietary fiber per 100 g dry matter (FAO/WHO
1994). The increase in the dietary fiber content after being processed into cookies could
have been due to the fact that an increase in temperature leads to a breakage of weak
bonds between the polysaccharide chains. Also, the glycosidic linkages in the dietary

fiber polysaccharides may be broken (FAO/WHO 1997).

Lysine and Tryptophan

OxL corn flour and OxL corn cookies exhibited the highest lysine content at 417.83
mg and 405.46 mg, respectively (Table 13). OxL corn flour contains high level of lysine
that adds quality to the protein of the cookies. QPM is reported to have higher level of
lysine than common maize (Abiose and Ikujenlola 2014). Among the cookies, OxL
cookies (405.46 mg) had the highest lysine followed by GST cookies (312.11 mg) and
GST-OxL corn cookies (298.05 mg). Lysine is reported to be easily depleted if the food
with lysine is cooked in high temperature. Lysine may have been destroyed by interaction
of carbohydrates by heat temperatures (Purcell and Walter 1982).

On the other hand, GST flour recorded higher tryptophan content (91.39 mg) than the
OxL corn flour (43.86 mg). Similarly, GST cookies (90.31 mg) had the highest

tryptophan content among the three cookies. It was followed by GST-OxL corn cookies


(90.31 mg) and the lowest tryptophan content was exhibited by OxL corn cookies (43.35

mg).

Mineral Content

In terms of the mineral content, significant differences in the zinc, iron and calcium
content of the flours and cookies were observed (Table 14). Giant swamp taro flour
exhibited higher zinc (0.90 mg/100g) and calcium (39.47 mg/100g) content than those
showed by OxL corn flour. However, iron content is significantly higher in OxL corn
flour (2.46 mg/100g) than giant swamp taro flour (1.30 m,/100g).

Among the cookies, GST cookies showed the highest zinc and calcium content

followed by GST-OxL corn cookies while OxL corn cookies had the least contents. In


terms of iron content, OxL corn cookies had the highest content at 2.33mg/100g followed
by GST cookies at 1.25 mg/100g then GST-OxL corn cookies at 1.22 mg/100g.

It can be observed that the mineral contents of corn flour and giant swamp taro flour
were lower compared to that of the cookies. Alcantara (2011) reported that there is a
reduction in the mineral content when taro flour is made into cookies. Minerals are
generally not sensitive to heat during processing but are susceptible into the processing or
cooking water. The reduction in the mineral contents during baking of the OxL corn
cookies, GST cookies and GST-OxL corn cookies could be due to higher temperature
(190°C) which causes the mineral degradation as a result of chemical changes like
oxidation (Olajide et al. 2011). Moreover, as heating continued, some of the mineral
elements such as zinc and iron may be partly lost as volatile compounds which

contributed to the reduction in the mineral content (Jacobs 1972).

B - carotene (Retinol Equivalent)

B-carotene is a major source and precursor of dietary vitamin A to human health. The
B-carotene content was significantly higher in GST flour (336.05 mg/100g) than OxL
corn flour (432.96 mg/100g).

The f-carotene content of cookies ranged from 432.96 mg to 514.78 mg. The GST
cookies also exhibited the highest amount of B-carotene (514.78 mg) among the cookies
(Table 15). This is in conjunction with the study of Englberger et al. (2008) who reported
that giant swamp taro contained high amounts of B-carotene concentrations which ranged
from 4 — 4486 11g/100 g in all the cultivars that were studied.

The B-carotene content was significantly higher in cookies than in the flours. Studies
revealed that in baked products such as bread, biscuits and cake, which are baked under
moderate conditions, it appeared that 80 to 100 % of the vitamin A survives the baking
process (Rice et al. 1941). B-carotene is not a heat sensitive nutrient. Heat actually
facilitates the breakdown of cell walls and effectively releases beta-carotene, thereby

making it more readily available for absorption in the bloodstream.

Nutritional Value and Health Benefits

Calories are provided by fats, protein and carbohydrates. The amount of calories in a
quantity or volume of a food preparation is called the energy density of the food and is a
good index for comparing the true value of different foods (Sajilata et al. 2002).

Energy content of the flours and cookies (kcal/100g) were calculated (Table 16).
Results showed that OxL corn flour had higher total energy density at 389.74 kcal/100g
than the GST flour at 372.28 kcal/100g. Among the three cookies, the OxL corn cookies
had the highest energy content (443.99 kcal/100g) followed by the GST-OxL cookies and
GST cookies (427.48 kcal and 390.32 kcal/100 g, respectively). Maize is generally
known to be high in carbohydrate and as such a good source of calories (Nuss and

Tanumihardjo 2011).


The OxL corn flour had significantly higher calories from fat, protein and
carbohydrates than GST flour. Similarly, OxL corn cookies had the highest calories from
fat, protein and carbohydrates among the cookies, followed by the GST-OxL corn

cookies and GST cookies (Table 16).

The contribution of the OxL corn flour, giant swamp taro flour and cookies for
energy, protein, iron, zinc, calcium and vitamin A in meeting the REI or RNI were
computed. According to Codex Alimentarius (2007), for a food to be considered a
“source” of protein, it should be >10 % of NRV per 100 grams while >20 % of NRV per
100 grams to be considered as a “high source”. On the other hand, in terms of vitamins,
minerals and energy, to be considered as “source”, food should be >15 % of NRV per

100 grams while >30 % of NRV per 100 grams for it to he considered as a “high source”.


In terms of dietary fiber, to be considered as “source”, food should have 3 g/100 g or 1.5
g/100 kcal or 10 % of daily reference value per serving whereas “high source” if food has
6 g/100 g or 3 g/100 kcal or 20 % of daily reference value per serving.

The REI/RNI contribution of OxL corn flour and GST flour per 100 grams for energy
and protein is shown is Table 17. Both the OxL corn flour and GST flour are high sources
of energy for 1 — 2 years old and good sources of energ, for 3 years old and above. For
protein, OxL corn flour, having the higher protein content than GST flour, is high source
of protein for male children aged 1 - 9 years old and female children aged | - 12 years
old whereas good source of protein for the rest of the age groups. On the other hand, GST
flour is source of protein for male children | — 5 years old and female children aged 1 -9
years old. Moreover, the GST flour is good source of protein for the rest of the age
groups. Because of the energy and protein content that these flours can supply, the OxL
corn flour and GST flour can therefore be used in the preparation of myriad of food
products such as complementary food, dehydrated soup, baked goods, snacks and
breakfast products.

Among the cookies, both GST cookies and GST-OxL cookies are high sources of
energy for 1 — 5 years old and good sources for 6 years old and above. The OxL corn
cookies are high sources of energy only for male children aged 1 — 5 years old and 1-9
years old female children and good source for 10 years old and above. The OxL corn
cookies are high sources of protein for children aged 1 — 9 years old and good source for

10 years old and above. On the other hand, GST cookies and GST-OxL corn cookies are


high sources of protein for female 1 — 9 years old and male children aged 1 — 5 years old
while good source for the rest of the ages (Table 18).

The OxL corn cookies, GST-OxL corn cookies and GST cookies can therefore serve
as alternatives to rice given that they are considered good sources of energy and protein.
This also coincides with the strategy of the Department of Agriculture which encourages
the public to diversify staples through production and consumption of non-rice staples
such as white corn and taro in order to lessen the pressure on rice. Moreover, these
cookies can be used for disaster relief and for emergency food rations since these are
convenient, ready-to-eat and good sources of energy and protein. The cookies can also be
eaten together with other protein-rich foods to improve its protein quality. These cookies
can also be beneficial especially to children in their developmental years to aid them in
their growth especially that the 8"" National Nutrition Survey (NNS) reported that there is
19.9 % and 29.1 % prevalence of underweight among children aged 1 — 5 years old and

5.08 — 10 years old, respectively.

Minerals such as iron and zinc are low in cereal and tuber-based diets. However,
incorporation of GST and OxL corn flours into production of complementary food, baked
goods and noodles would help improve the adequacy of iron and zinc intake in the diet.
The OxL corn flour is considered a high source of iron for children 1 — 2 years old and
good source for the 3 years old and above, except 10 — 49 years old females. On the other
hand, GST flour is a good source of iron for | — 2 years old only (Table 19).

Among the cookies, OxL corn cookies are the only cookies that are high source of
iron for | — 12 years old children and good source for lt vears old and above. The GST-
OxL corn cookies and GST cookies are good sources of iron for ages 1 — 2 years old only
(Table 20). This implies that OxL corn cookies can serve as vehicle to improve iron
intake in the diet. It may become an important source of iron for those who cannot afford
better sources of this mineral such as meat and its derivatives. The 8'" NNS have reported
that 11.3 % prevalence of anemia is found among 1 to 5 years old children. Thus,
consumption of the cookies can also contribute to prevent consequences such as impaired
physical and cognitive development associated with iron deficiency anemia especially for
children.

The GST flour is a good source of zinc for children aged 1 — 9 years old and female
adults aged 19 years old and above. On the other hand, GST cookies and GST-OxL corn
cookies are considered good sources of zinc. GST cookies is good source of zinc for
children aged 1 — 9 years old and female adults aged 19 years old and above whereas
GST-OxL corn cookies is a good source of zinc for male children aged 1 — 2 years old

only and female children aged 1 — 5 years old and female adults aged 19 years old and


above (Table 20). However, the OxL corn flour and OxL corn cookies have less than 15
% RNI contribution of zinc. Nevertheless, this implies that the GST and GST-OxL corn
cookies can also serve as good vehicle to improve the zinc intake in the diet. Zinc is
known to play a critical role in biological processes including cell growth, differentiation
and metabolism and deficiency in this micronutrient restricts childhood growth and
decreases resistance to infections, which contribute significantly to morbidity and
mortality in young children (Prasad 1991). Long-term insufficient nutrient intake and
frequent infection causes stunting or low height-for-age. Meta — analyses of intervention
studies in a variety of countries have demonstrated a positive association between zinc
supplementation and linear growth in children (Imdad and Bhutta 2011). Consequently,
consumption of the cookies may help reduce the 29.9 % prevalence of stunting among
5.08 — 10 years old children (FNRI - DOST 2013).

Furthermore, the OxL corn flour, GST flour and cookies per 100 grams are not
considered sources of calcium (Table 19 and 20). In spite of this, consumption of these
products can still improve overall nutrition by inclusion or mixing it with other nutrient —

dense food in the diet.

Cereals are naturally low in lipids, therefore, they tend to be low in the fat soluble
vitamin A, which is present as the precursor carotenoids (Kulp 2000). Vitamin A is also
low generally in root crops and tubers. Furthermore, % RNI contribution for vitamin A
showed that 100 grams of OxL corn flour, GST flour and the cookies are not good
sources of vitamin A (Table 21). Although the % RNI contribution for vitamin A did not
meet the 15 % condition to be considered as source, it can be noted that the flours and
cookies can still provide a fair amount of vitamin A which ranged from 4.0 to 7.0 % in
GST flours and 3.16 to 6.32 % in OxL corn flour while 4.51 to 9.02 % for OxL corn
cookies, 5.33 to 9.34 % for GST-OxL corn cookies and 5.36 to 10.73 for GST cookies.
Consumption of these vitamin A-containing foods coun still contribute to the diet if
eaten with other food products daily. Giant swamp taro was noted to contribute higher %
RNI for vitamin A despite knowing that tubers contain low vitamin A. This implies that
this crop should not be neglected but rather utilized as food ingredient in order to help
alleviate vitamin A deficiency which is caused by habitually low intake of vitamin A
foods. Vitamin A deficiency is still a public health problem but decreased from severe in
2003 to moderate in 2008 (FNRI — DOST 2008).

Aside from its high nutrient content, the OxL corn flour and GST flour can also be
utilized as an ingredient in making snack food items because of its dietary fiber content,
which could be beneficial for persons with gastrointestinal problems and with high blood
cholesterol level. The dietary fiber content of the corkies ranged from 1.11 - 2.53
g/100g. The values did not meet the condition of 3 g/100 g or 6 g/100 g to be claimed as

source or high source of dietary fiber, respectively (Table 22). Nevertheless, these

cookies can still included to add variety to the food items in the diet that may prevent
colon cancer and cardiovascular diseares.

Moreover, since the OxL corn flour, GST flour and GST cookies are classified to
have intermediate amylose while OxL corn cookies and GST-OxL corn cookies are
classified to have low amylose (Table 11), these products can therefore serve as a more
beneficial food for diabetic and hyperlipidemic individuals. Starchy foods with high
amylose levels are associated with lower blood glucose levels and slower emptying of the
human gastrointestinal tract compared to those with low levels of this macromolecule
(Frei et al. 2003). Amylose molecules are harder to digest than amylopectin thus food
with more amylose tends to have lower glycemic index (GI). Studies have suggested that
low GI diet play a role in preventing obesity, diabetes and heart disease.

High amounts of lysine and tryptophan were exhibited by the cookies (Table 12). The
RNI contribution for lysine and tryptophan of the flours and cookies were presented in
Tables 23 and 24. Consumption of the cookies with lysine can help during the growth
spurt of early childhood especially that there is a high prevalence (29.9 %) of stunting
among Filipino children aged 5.08 to 10 years old (FNRI — DOST 2013). On the other
hand, tryptophan provided by these products would be essential for the maintenance of
body tissues especially in adults. It would also be important in preventing niacin
deficiency and raising serotonin levels, a neurotransmitter that helps regulate appetite,
sleep patterns and mood. Thus, inclusion of the cookies in the diet and in combination
with other protein sources would improve dietary intake of protein and essential amino

acids,


Storage Stability

The microbial load of the cookies in terms of total plate count (TPC) and yeast and
mold growth is shown in Tables 25 and 26, respectively. After one day, GST-OxL corn
cookies had the least TPC whereas GST cookies had the highest. In general, total growth
of microorganisms for each sample gradually increased over one month of storage

(Figure 6).

On the other hand, the highest yeast and mold count before storage was recorded in
GST-OxL corn cookies whereas OxL corn cookies had the least (Fig. 7). The yeast and
mold growth have increased after one month of storage. The increase in microbial load as
the storage period lengthened might have been due to a corresponding increase in water
activity during storage (Table 26). Nevertheless, the microbial load of the products is still
within the limit for consumption by the International Commission for Microbiological
Specification of Foods (ICMSF 1996). Ready-to-eat foods with microbial loads between

10‘ and 10° cfu/g are tolerable and those with 10° cfu/g are unacceptable. It is known that


total plate count values for cereal and cereal based products exceeding 10° cfu/g are
considered microbiologically unsafe (Viosencu and Misca 2005). Note, however, that the
type (pathogenic or not) and not the total number of microorganisms in the food sample
should be the basis for its safety.

Microbiological studies indicated that the cookies packaged in metalized aluminum
foil pouches and placed at room temperature up to one month has good stability as the

microbial load remained within the permissible limits.

Water Activity

Water activity (ay) affects food stability and therefore it must be brought to a suitable
level at the conclusion of drying and maintained within an acceptable range of activity
values during storage. Freshly baked biscuits usually have water activity about 0.3 (Wade
1988).

Results showed that water activity of the cookies have increased during the one
month storage period (Table 27). Both GST cookies and GST-OxL corn cookies was

observed to have higher water activity at the end of the study period (i.e. after 4 weeks)


from 0.53 to 0.58 and 0.37 to 0.39, respectively. This is in agreement with the study of
water activity of bread samples which increased during the five days storage period
(Ayub ct al. 2003). On the other hand, water activity of OaL corn cookies decreased from
0.57 to 0.52 after one month of storage. An irregular ascending trend has also been
observed in the water activity value of local and foreign biscuits in Bangladesh over three
months of storage (Chowdhury et al. 2012).

Microorganisms generally have optimum and minimum levels of ay for growth
depending on other growth factors in their environments. Food deterioration due to
microbial growth is not likely to occur at ay < 0.6 (Singh and Cadwallader 2002). Most
spoilage bacteria do not grow below ay = 0.91, whereas spoilage molds can grow as low
as 0.80. With respect to food-poisoning bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus can grow as low
as 0.86, whereas Clostridium botulinum does not grow below 0.94. The lowest reported
value for foodborne bacteria is 0.75 for halophiles, ‘vhereas xerophilic molds and
osmophilic yeasts have been reported to grow at ay values of 0.65 and 0.61, respectively
(Jay et al. 2005). Results of the water activity of the cookies was reported to be less than
0.6, however, yeast and mold growth was observed after day 1 (Figure 7). After four
weeks, water activity of the GST-OxL corn cookies was still within the critical limit of
0.43 for biscuits and crackers (Labuza and Contreras-Medellen 1981). On the other hand,
GST and OxL corn cookies exhibited higher water activity compared to the critical limit
for biscuits but remained to be less than 0.6. If water activity value is lower than 0.70, it

prevents microbiological damage, but to prevent deteriorative chemical and biochemical


reactions, it is necessary that the dryness can be reduced to a water activity value lower

than 0.3 (Roudaut et al. 2000).

Relationship Between Microbial Count and Length of Storage

The correlation between yeast and mold count, total plate count and length of storage
was determined using Spearman’s rho rank correlation (Appendix Table 1). There was a
very strong positive correlation found between total plate count and yeast and mold count
(rs = 0.851, p = 0.012). This indicates a direct relationship which implies that the higher
the total plate count, the higher the yeast and mold count.

On the other hand, computed coefficient between total plate count and length of
storage is 0.563 while between yeast and mold count and length of storage is 0.797 which
can be described as moderate positive and strong positive correlation, respectively. This
indicates a direct relationship between the variables which implies that the longer the
length of storage, the greater the value of total plate count and yeast and mold count

(Figure 6 and 7).


Sensory Evaluation

Sensory analysis is a limiting factor to determine the acceptance critical point and
also the product shelf life time. Indeed, sensory assessment is critical in stability tests
once the product can be rejected by potential consumers for containing unacceptable
attributes even before presenting microbiological risks or low content of nutrients.

Changes in the sensory attributes and overall acceptability on a 9-point Hedonic scale
at room temperature are given in Table 28. It was observed that there was a gradual but
significant decrease (p<0.05) in some of the sensory parameters during storage. The color
and texture of the cookies did not change significantly as the storage period increased.
Water activity affects the textural properties of foods. Low ay products normally have
texture attributes described as crisp and crunchy, while at higher ay levels, undesirable
change to soggy texture can be observed (Nollet 2004). However, the decrease in the
mean scores for texture among the cookies was not significant as storage period
increased,

During the initial week, OxL corn cookies were evaluated as “liked moderately”
while GST and GST-OxL corn cookies were evaluated as “liked slightly” in terms of
general acceptability. As storage period increased, significant differences were observed
in the aroma and flavor among the cookies. In the 4" week of storage, it was noted that
there was a slight loss of aroma among the cookies. However, the OxL corn cookies were
the most preferred in terms of aroma followed by GST cookies then GST-OxL corn

cookies.


In terms of flavor, initially, OxL cookies were “liked moderately” while both GST
and GST-OL corn cookies were “liked slightly’. A significant gradual decline was
observed in the flavor of the cookies. It was noted that there was a slight decline in flavor
and that GST and GST-OxL corn cookies were noted to be slightly less sweet during the
4" week storage period. Wada (1998) reported that absorption of moisture causes flavor
deterioration during storage of cookies for longer periods. The change in flavor may also

be due to the constant breakdown of triglycerides into their constituents, i.e. free fatty

Means with the same superscript across storage period (weeks) are not significant (p>0.05) using Friedman
Anova


acid or due to the oxidation of fats. Oxidation of fats as well as Maillard reaction may
also be the main causes for deterioration in the overall acceptability of the cookies.
Similar results were presented by other researchers who reported the same decreasing
trends in taste, texture, appearance and overall acceptability with increase in storage time
(Elahi 2006; Wada 1998). Shelf life study of biscuits revealed that up to 60 days of
storage, the overall acceptability of biscuits was in the category of “like moderately”
(Sharma et al. 2013).

During the 4" week of storage, it can be observed that GST and GST-OxL corn
cookies were evaluated as “neither like nor dislike” in terms of aroma, flavor and general
acceptability. On the other hand, OxL corn cookies were rated as “liked moderately” for

the aroma while “liked slightly” for flavor and overall acceptability.

Relationship Between Sensory Attributes, Acceptability and Length of Storage

There were significant but weak negative correlation (Appendix Table 2) between
length of storage and sensory attributes such as color (rs = - 0.229, p = 0.005), aroma (r; =
- 0.209, p = 0.010), texture (r, = - 0.212, p = 0.009), and flavor (r, = - 0.215, p = 0.00).
On the other hand, a very weak negative correlation was found between length of storage
and general acceptability (r; = - 0.176, p = 0.031). These results indicate an inverse
relationship which implies that as the length of storage increased, the value of sensory

attributes and general acceptability have decreased (Table 28).


Relationship Between Microbial Count and General Acceptability

A Spearman’s rho rank correlation (Appendix Table 1) was run to determine the
relationship between microbial count and general acceptability. The computed correlation
coefficient between total plate count and general acceptability is - 0.737 and described as
strong and negative correlation indicating an inverse rel..ionship. Similarly, there was a
strong and negative correlation between yeast and mold count and general acceptability,
which was statistically significant (r; = - 0.638, p = 0.000). This implies that the greater
the value of total plate count and yeast and mold count, the lower the value of general

acceptability.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

Utilization of Obatanpa-x-Lagkitan (OxL) corn flour and giant swamp taro (GST)
flour in the production of cookies was investigated. Different GST:OxL flour blends were
processed into cookies and subjected to sensory evaluation using 7-point Hedonic scale.
Sensory evaluation revealed that all the cookies were found acceptable by the panelists.
Significant differences were found in aroma, flavor and general acceptability of the
cookies.

In the study, the nutritional value of flour and cookies and storage stability of the
cookies were determined. The 100 % OxL corn cookie., 100 % GST cookies and the
most acceptable cookies were studied. Specifically, the study showed the following:

1. The 90:10 GST:OxL corn cookies was the most acceptable cookies in terms of

aroma, flavor and general acceptability.

2. Proximate composition except crude fat, carbohydrate profile and mineral content
significantly decreased after processing flours into cookies. Total dietary fiber and
B - carotene content were significantly higher in cookies than flours. The OxL
corn cookies exhibited the highest total energy among the cookies.

3. Based on their nutrient contribution (% REI/RNI), OxL corn flour, GST flour,
OxL corn cookies, GST-OxL corn cookies and GST cookies are sources of
energy, protein, iron and zinc.

4. Total plate count and yeast and mold count increased within one month storage

period. Water activity of the cookies increased after one month of storage.


Significant changes were observed in aroma, flavor and general acceptability of
the cookies as the storage period increased.

Microbial count and general acceptability have strong negative correlation while
have strong positive correlation between total plate count and yeast and mold
count. Microbial count and length of storage also have significant and strong
positive correlation. There were significant but weak negative correlation between
length of storage and sensory attributes such as color, aroma, texture and flavor.
On the other hand, a very weak negative correlation was found between length of

storage and general acceptability.

RECOMMENDATIONS

The study has provided information on the nutritive value of the OxL corn flour and
its cookies, GST flour and its cookies and GST-OxL corn cookies as well as the storage
stability of the cookies. Cookies were found to have high nutritive value and are shelf
stable for a period of one month. However, further work should be done to improve the
nutritive content of the cookies. Since giant swamp taro is an indigenous tuber, anti-
nutrients such as oxalate and phytate should be investigated. Moreover, nutrient
bioavailability of corn, giant swamp taro and its products may also be studied. Another
factor that can be investigated is the physical properties of cookies as well as the
physicochemical properties of the flours. Further studies should also be done on the effect
of longer storage period and different packaging materials to prolong the shelf life of the
products, The utilization of the cookies as disaster food may also be further studied.

The Obatanpa-x-Lagkitan corn and giant swamp taro are commodities that need to be
promoted and utilized. The utilization of composite flours from corn and taro can help
minimize the importation of wheat flour and thereby in. rove the flour industry. Other
food products processed from composite flours that are acceptable and palatable should
be explored so that these will be locally produced and readily available in the market. The
potential of giant swamp taro flour in various food products can create opportunities to
local farmers to expand their production of giant swamp taro. Hence, information
dissemination on the value of Obatanpa-x-Lagkitan corn and giant swamp taro should be

promoted.
