ABSTRACT

Peatlands are freshwater wetlands characterized by the deep accumulation of partly
decomposed organic materials called “peat” and are an important terrestrial carbon pool.
However, human interventions such as land use changes and unsustainable land
management have adversely affected peatland ecosystems. One negative impact of these
activities is that peatlands become sources of CO₂ emissions. In the Philippines, very little
attention is given to peatland GHG emissions and how these contribute to global warming.
This study is a first attempt to measure GHG emissions of a peatland in the country. The
main objective of the study was to determine the degree of emissions of peat-derived
greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide
(N₂0) to the atmosphere across vegetation cover types. Taking into consideration selected
soil physico-chemical parameters and other environmental variables, the extent of soil CO₂,
CH₄ and N₂O fluxes across land uses in Bambanin peatland, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro
was investigated during wet and dry seasons. Results revealed that the highest average
gross CO₂ flux of 232.47 Mg ha⁻¹y⁻¹ was released at the cultivated area followed by the
forestland (171.02 Mg ha⁻¹y⁻¹) and grassland (102.88 Mg ha⁻¹y⁻¹) owing to lowered water
table level and decomposition of soil organic matter. The low water table greatly
influenced the CH₄ emissions across sites especially in the dry season. Negative emissions
were displayed by the forested (0.002 Mg ha⁻¹y⁻¹ and cultivated (-0.003 Mg ha-1y-1) sites
while grassland emitted 0.013 Mg ha⁻¹y⁻¹. The highest gross N₂0 emission of 0.045 Mg ha⁻¹y⁻¹, on the other hand, was observed during the dry season at the grassland site as a result of burning where a 93% increase from wet season’s emission was recorded. In
contrast, both forested and cultivated sites demonstrated a decline in the N₂O emissions of
58% and 86%, respectively, from wet to dry season. Future projections by 2050 indicated
that forest cover in the peatland will decrease by 15% while cropland, grassland, built-up
and perennial crop areas will be increased by 11%, 22%, 74 % and 75%, respectively. If
forest conversions and expansion of croplands and built-up areas will prevail in the
succeeding years, higher emissions of these potent greenhouse gases to the atmosphere are
very likely to happen. In terms of the concept and existence of a peatland in Bambanin,
respondents tended to have a relatively high level of awareness. However, deeper
understanding on the importance of peatland and the impacts of anthropogenic activities
on the overall state/condition of the Bambanin peatland was lacking. Results of this study
could be used in formulating mitigation policies particularly on the land use management
that will address issues on peatland hydrology, agricultural activities and human
encroachment to the protected area, The participation of the community in the decision-
making process and implementation of local policies will also help in the sustainable peatland management.

CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION

Background of the Study

The most well-known of all wetland types in the world that represent 50 to 70% of
global wetlands are the peatlands (Joosten, Hans; Clarke, 2002). Peatlands are wetland
ecosystems characterized by the deep accumulation of partly decomposed organic
materials called “peat” (Vitt, 2013; Posa, Wijedasa, & Corlett, 2011; Purnomo et al., 2005;
Larocque et al., 2016; Charman, 2009; Jaenicke, Rieley, Mott, Kimman, & Siegert, 2008;

Sopo, 2004). Peat is formed from dead and decaying plant materials that have been

accumulated over thousands of years under waterlogged, acidic, nutrient poor and anoxic
environment which slows its decomposition (Dohong, Aziz, & Dargusch, 2017; J. Wang,
Miettinen, Hooijer, Liew, & Kwoh, 2010; Rastogi et al., 2019; Renou-Wilson et al., 2019;
Upton, Vane, Girkin, Turner, & Sjégersten, 2018; Xu, Morris, Liu, & Holden, 2018;

Weissert & Disney, 2013; Bonn et al., 2014).

Globally, about 8% of peatland areas are found in the tropics (Hergouale’h &
Verchot, 2014: Melling, Hatano, & Kah, 2005; Melling, Hatano, & Goh, 2005) mainly in
Southeast Asia covering an area of approximately 29 million hectares (60% of all tropical
peatlands) of which majority is found in Indonesia (Furukawa, Inubushi, Ali, Itang, &
Tsuruta, 2005: Purnomo et al., 2005; Murdiyarso, Hergouale’h, & Verchot, 2010;

Miettinen et al., 2012; Hergoualc’H & Verchot, 2011; Miettinen, Shi, & Liew, 2016; Kim

et al., 1990) which is considered as the fourth largest in the world (Sorensen, 1993; Itoh,
Okimoto, Hirano, & Kusin, 2017). Comparatively smaller areas are located in Thailand,

Brunei, Vietnam and the Philippines (Murdiyarso et al., 2010).

Based on the statistics for tropical peatlands, Philippines has a mean area of around
10,700 hectares (Page, Rieley, & Wist, 2006; Page et al., 2006), 110 km? or equivalent to
~11,000 hectares (Joosten, 2010). There are two major sites in the Philippines where
peatlands have been confirmed: the Caimpugan peatland at Agusan Marsh in Agusan del
Sur and the Leyte Sab-a Basin at Alang-alang, Leyte (DENR, 2016). Further, recent
assessments made by the Biodiversity Management Bureau (BMB) and the Ecosystems
Research and Development Bureau (ERDB) of the Department of Environment and
Natural Resources (DENR), confirmed additional peatland sites which were found in
Victoria, Oriental Mindoro; Lalaguna and Rizal in Lopez, Quezon and La Paz and

Talacogon in Agusan del Sur.

Tropical peatlands are an important terrestrial carbon pool and account for one third
of the world’s soil C pool (Turetsky, Wieder, Halsey, & Vitt, 2002; Schulte et al., 2019;
Dhandapani, Ritz, Evers, Yule, & Sjdgersten, 2019; Radomski, Gilmer, Byers, &
McGovern, 2019; Lees, Quaife, Artz, Khomik, & Clark, 2018; Xing et al., 2015; Vitt, 2013;
Weissert & Disney, 2013; Charman, 2009). However, human disturbances pose huge
impacts to the peatland ecosystems through agriculture and human settlement by forest
removal, land use changes, fires and land drainage (Dohong et al., 2017; IPCC, 2001; Urak,
Hartel, Gallé, & Balog, 2017; Hooijer et al., 2010; Pemberton, 2005; Strack, 2008),

Draining peatlands induces soil subsidence (Uda, Schouten, & Hein, 2018) and increases

decomposition (Laine, Mehtatalo, Tolvanen, Frolking, & Tuittila, 2019; Ojanen et al.,
2019) leading to significant emissions of CO2. Peatlands can also be a huge source of N20
emission due to human activities and climate change (Gong, Wu, Vogt, & Le, 2019; Hadi
et al., 2000; Leifeld, 2018). The Caimpugan peatland within the Agusan Marsh located in
Agusan del Sur, Philippines, is very likely to become a net carbon dioxide source as this
peatland area is being converted to agricultural land and ecotourism area (Alibo, 2011).
Accordingly, more than 80% of the anthropogenic emissions are credited from agriculture
(Liimatainen et al., 2018). Since this ecosystem is highly vulnerable to human impact, they
become sources of carbon emissions (Murdiyarso et al., 2010) that contribute to global
warming (Xu et al., 2018; Kim et al., 1990). The synthesis report of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2001 stated that concentrations of atmospheric
greenhouse gases such as CO2 and CH, and their radiative forcings have largely increased
which can be attributed to anthropogenic activities to include among others burning of
fossil fuel, deforestation, land use change, rice agriculture and landfills. ‘The current
scenarios on climate change have been strongly linked with greenhouse house gases
(GHGs) emissions because of their atmospheric warming effects (Leng, Ahmed, & Jalloh,

2018).

Significance of the Study

Climate change is a serious and alarming problem being faced by humanity.
President Rodrigo Duterte already signed the Paris Agreement, a legally binding
international agreement on climate change ratified by 155 Parties globally, on February 28,

2017 following certain steps on the ratification process. Such treaty signified the country’s

commitment to take efforts in reducing carbon emissions by 70% by 2030. This is also in
support to one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG #13-Climate Action), and that
is, by taking urgent actions in combating climate change.

In the Philippines, however, studies on COz emissions are focused largely on
industrial processes, transportation emissions and GHG emissions in both lowland
(agricultural) and forest ecosystems. USAID (2016) reported that the Philippine GHG
emissions were dominated by the energy sectors followed by agriculture and industrial
processes while the Senate Economic Planning Office (2013) confirmed that energy sector
was the highest emitter of GHG in the Philippines followed by both industrial and
agricultural sectors and a small percentage from the forestry sector. There were conducted
studies on Philippine agriculture’s GHG emission such as the lowland rice GHG emissions
in IRRI experimental stations (Ku, Hayashi, Agbisit, & Villegas-Pangga, 2017) and
seasonal variations in the GHG emissions by open field burning of rice straws in the whole
Philippines (Gadde, Menke, & Wassmann, 2009). Studies on forest-related GHG
emissions were also implemented including the carbon sequestration rates and C stocks of
various vegetative cover and soil in Leyte geothermal reservation (Lasco et al., 2002), soil
GHG fluxes of a tropical mangrove forest in Palawan (Castillo, Apan, Maraseni, & Salmo,
2017), the Philippine forest ecosystem’s carbon stock and sequestration rate where these
forest lands were found to be a net sink of GHGs (Lasco & Pulhin, 2003) and greenhouse
gas mitigation and carbon sequestration potential of selected Philippine ecosystems (Ilao,
Salang, & Floresca, n.d.). Other studies were on the carbon dioxide inventory of coconut
biodiesel program (Tan, Culaba, & Purvis, 2004) and surface carbon dioxide fluxes at a

site near the University of the Philippines-Diliman where CO? fluxes were influenced by

air temperature, sea level pressure, transboundary burning of biomass, existence of power

plants and landfills (Macatangay et al., 2014).

It is apparent that very little attention is given to peatland greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions and how these contribute to global warming. It is high time that policy makers
consider crafting policies on the conservation, protection and sustainable management of
peatlands as well as safeguarding long-term carbon storage. These efforts guarantee
continuous provision of ecosystem services these peatlands offer, hence, this research

study.

GHG emissions of peatlands in the Philippines have yet to be studied. Some
peatlands are alienable and disposable, some are titled which are at greater risk of
unmanaged utilization. Research undertakings need to be done to gather significant data
on peatland emission rates. Results of such studies may be used in formulating mitigation
policies especially in restoring peatland hydrology. This is a way to inhibit peat oxidation

and widespread degradation of peatlands.

Objectives of the Study

This research study aims to quantify information on the extent of GHG emissions
in Bambanin, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro peatland considering various vegetation cover
types (cultivated, forestland, grassland) and determine how agriculture, anthropogenic
activities and other peatland disturbances result in the imbalance of these greenhouse gases

contributing greatly to climate change.

The general objective of this study was to determine the degree of emissions of
peat-derived greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (COz), methane (CHs) and

nitrous oxide (N20) to the atmosphere across vegetation cover types.

The specific objectives were as follows:

a) To determine the composition of the existing vegetation and avi-fauna in
the peatland area

b) To determine the soil and water characteristics of the Bambanin peatland

©) To assess greenhouse gas emissions from different land uses between
seasons

d) To determine the rate of land-use conversion and deforestation specifically
changes in 1953, 2009 and 2108 land uses and project future scenarios like
the 2050 estimated land use

€) To assess the level of awareness of the community members surrounding

the peatland on the ecological services (ES) it provides

Scope and Limitations of the Study

Specific objective (a) will provide a listing of the existing vegetation in the area,
the vegetation’s ecological and economical importance as well as the avi-fauna’s species
composition, distribution and conservation status. Specific objective (b) will give baseline
information on the quality of water but quantification (volume) of water is not included;
information on soil characteristics such as pH. nutrients and texture will be included in the

results together with the measurement of carbon stock, bulk density and soil moisture

contents. However, the soil profiling per layer was not included. Specific objective (c)
will provide baseline information on the degree of greenhouse gas emissions across land
uses that would represent wet and dry seasons. Various environmental factors that
significantly influence the rate of emissions will also be discussed. Specific objective (4)
will determine the changes in the land cover and deforestation rates of Bambanin peatland
from 1953-2018 and will provide future projections on the changes in the land cover of the
peatland up to 2050. Last specific objective (e) will determine the level of awareness of
the community members on their knowledge on the peatland ecosystem, its importance,
threats and effects of anthropogenic activities on peatland degradation.
This study conducted a one-time collection of data both in the wet and dry seasons

which may have potential impacts on the findings presented herein. Trends on soil and

water characteristics as well as GHG emissions could not be established as the results can
be considered as clear snapshots on the existing peatland characteristics. Soil profiling per
layer which include determination of available minerals and peat thickness was not
included. Bulk density measurement was also limited to the topsoil layer (0-30 cm).
Financial constraint was the foremost cause of such experimental design.

Convenience sampling was done since the soil gas flux system used could not be
placed in watery areas. The soil corer (~3cm from soil surface) where the gas chamber is.

inserted must not be submerged in water. This limits the peatland area where data

collection can be conducted.

CHAPTER II

REVIEW OF LITERATURE

Peatland Characteristics

Peatland is a wetland ecosystem with a relatively thick (>40 cm) soil layer of
organic matter as a result of long periods of saturation (Trettin, 2008; Evans, 2013).
Organic matter accumulates when the decomposition process is slow that normally occurs
in anaerobic conditions (Jenny, 1941).

High amounts of organic matter is one of the distinguishing characteristics of a
peatland ecosystem. It includes all organic materials found in soils regardless of its origin
or state of decomposition (B. W. Murphy, 2014). The organic matter content of a soil is
expressed as percent by weight and is affected by many factors which include soil type,
temperature, moisture, past cropping history and others (Soil Test Handbook for Georgia,
2008). It is a main factor that defines quality, efficiency, properties and ecological
functioning of soils (Kuderik, Tokarski, Demyan, Merbach, & Siewert, 2018; B. Murphy,
2015; Williams, Fogel, Bethe, & Plante, 2018; Reeves D. W., 1997; FAO, 2017). Soil
organic matter is by far the biggest source of soil organic carbon (SOC) that plays an
essential function in restoring and maintaining carbon balance (Santoiemma, 2018) and in
global C cycling through carbon sequestration and emissions (Ondrasek et al., 2019;
Yoshida et al., 2018; Poirier, Roumet, & Munson, 2018). SOM helps in maintaining soil

structural stability (Jensen et al., 2019), nutrient cycling (B. Murphy. 2015) and improving

soil water retention because of its high capacity to absorb and hold huge amount of water
making it one of its main physical properties (Obour, Jensen, Lamandé, Watts, &

Munkholm, 2018; B. Murphy, 2015; Clivot et al., 2017).

In rice production, SOM functions four vital ecosystem roles which include
resistance to soil erosion, water retention of soil, soil fertility, and soil biodiversity
(Amanullah et al., 2019; de Santana, de Giuseppe, de Souza, & Poppi, 2019; Frouz, 2018).
OM serves as a binding agent between the pores/particles. Organic matter is the most
significant factor for sandy soils with particle size ranges between 2 mm to 0.05 mm
(Murphy, 2015).

Organic matter was observed to be high even in a well-drained peatland. The very
high level of organic matter for mineral soil is >6% while peat soil’s OM level should be
>12% (Nyi et al., 2017); >15% according to Agvise Laboratories (Northwood, North
Dakota), approximately 20% (Couwenberg, 2009); at least 30% (Craft & Craft, 2016;
Joosten, Hans; Clarke, 2002; International Peatland Society, n.d.; Joosten, 2009) or > 50%-
60% (Marshall et al., 2018; Ismail-Meyer, Stolt, & Lindbo, 2018; Charman, 2009).

Organic matter is also said to be directly related to the peat soils nitrogen content.
N accordingly increases with increasing OM. Literature suggests that 83 kg of N is present
in every | tonne of soil organic carbon (B. Murphy, 2015) and that most soil N occurs in
organic, approximately 90-95%, rather than inorganic forms making SOM the largest
source or stock of stable nitrogen (N) in soils and microorganisms (Fine, Schmidt, &
Martinez, 2018: Smith et al., 2015). A study revealed that most nitrogen (N) in boreal

forest soils are bound to soil organic matter (SOM) while SOM decomposition initiates soil

organic N consumption (Kieloaho et al., 2016). Another study showed the positive
correlation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in peatland with total nitrogen
(TN), ice, the higher level of nutrients such as N is present, the higher the content of DOC
in this ecosystem (T. Zhang et al., 2016). Another work done in the cultivated and natural
soils of India showed the relationship of soil organic matter (SOM) and Nitrogen taking
into account the soil type, annual rainfall and temperature (Jha et al., 2014). A review of
studies conducted in the agricultural soils of Oklahoma planted with wheat (2004), Nigeria
on savanna woodland (2003) and South Africa’s coarse-textured grassland (2001) revealed
a reduction on nitrogen along with a reduction in carbon content (McLauchlan, 2006).
Organic carbon and nitrogen (N) normally increase during decomposition (Tfaily et.al,
2014) and that their cycles are linked as they contain a significant quantity of soil organic
matter (Karlsson, 2012).

Peat is very high in carbon C content which is approximately 50%-58% of the dry
organic matter (Joosten, Hans; Clarke, 2002; USDA, 2015; Perie & Ouimet, 2008; Bianchi,
Miyazawa, De Oliveira, & Pavan, 2008; Bajgai, Hulugalle, Kristiansen, & McHenry, 2014;
Garcia, Nannipieri, & Hernandez, 2018). Layers of carbon rich peat are accumulated from
dead and decaying materials under waterlogged conditions (Bain, et.al, 2011; IUCN,
2017). Semi-natural and undamaged peatlands are capable of accumulating carbon at a rate
of around 30-70 tonnes per km? per year (Bain et.al, 2011). Globally, peatlands contain
more than 550 gigatonnes of carbon that represent 42% of all soil carbon. This amount
surpasses the carbon stored in all other vegetation types including the world’s forests. An
amount of 0.37 gigatonnes of CO> is being sequestered by this ecosystem per year (IUCN,

2017). As they store huge amounts of carbon and act as sink for GHGs, peatland plays a

very crucial role in global carbon cycle (Marwanto, Sabiham, & Funakawa, 2019; Dohong

et al., 2017; Marsden & Ebmeier, 2012).

Peatland Distribution

Peatlands are practically found in every country around the world. Joostens and
Clarke (2002) reported the worldwide peatland distribution in their book on Wise Use of

Mires and Peatlands (Table 1).

Ecosystem services

Globally, peatlands are found in boreal, tropical, and temperate regions where they
essentially provide various ecosystem services (Schulte et al., 2019). Page et al. (2006)
discussed peatland’s vital functions such as carbon storage, flood control, climate
stabilization and groundwater recharge. Products that can be generated from peatlands
include forest resources, fisheries and agricultural resources. Peatland ecosystem supports
a wide range of biological diversity and that it is a refuge of rare and threatened species
which can only be found in this type of ecosystem. Marsden & Ebmeier (2012) discussed
the benefits that can be provided by the Scottish peatlands which include climate
regulation, habitat of nationally and internationally important biodiversity, water
regulation and aesthetic and cultural benefits.

In assessing and valuing the ecosystem services that peatlands provide, Reed, Bonn,
Evans, Glenk, & HansjUrgens (2014) enumerated the various ES that UK peatland offers
such as carbon storage, source of clean drinking water, provision of recreational
opportunities, used for livestock grazing, sporting interests, agriculture, habitat for
biodiversity, climate and water regulating services.

Joosten & Clarke (2002) provided a long list of values and functions of peatlands
showing their significance in global, regional and local terms. This exceptional ecosystem
is utilized for agriculture; energy generation; provision of food, raw materials and
medicines; source of drinking water; habitat of many species of plants and animals;
regulation of global, regional and local climates; provision of recreation and aesthetic

functions.


In doing the Cultural Ecosystem Service (CES) valuation and Cost-Benefit
Analysis (CBA) of Dutch peatlands, van Hardeveld et al. (2018) mentioned the many
ecosystem services that this peatland provides which include erosion regulation, climate
regulation, provision of food, venue for recreation activities such as bird watching and
hiking, farming and water provision.

The functions of blanket peatlands that can only be found in temperate regions of
the world were discussed by Parry, Holden, & Chapman (2014). Functions that are enjoyed
by human populations include carbon storage, provision of water, recreational/leisure
activities, used as pastureland for animals, biodiversity habitat and regulation of water
flow.

In implementing the field trials to restore peatland hydrology, especially the
degraded peatland parts of Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, Ritzema, Limin, Kusin,
Jauhiainen, & Wésten (2014) listed some important roles that these peatlands play which
include carbon storage, habitats of rare, endemic and endangered species, storage of excess
rainfall and provision of timber and non-timber products as a source of livelihood for local
people.

Wosten, J.H.M., Rieley, J.O. and Page (2008) in their publication on the restoration
of tropical peatlands mentioned that peatlands are a home for many endemic and
endangered plant and animal species; provide water for drinking and irrigation; act as
buffers between salt and freshwater hydrological systems; carbon storage; provision of
food, shelter and medicine.

The numerous vital functions that tropical peatlands perform, products generated

from them and other valuable attributes were discussed by S. Page & Rieley (1998). Vital

functions include groundwater recharge that occurs when there is a downward movement
of water from surface water to groundwater and allows water to enter aquifers for human
consumption; flood control as peatlands have high water retention capacity and carbon
storage since peatlands are huge carbon sinks. Products generated comprise forest
resources where valuable timber products such as ramin and agathis and other non-timber
products can be harvested; fisheries as peat swamps serve as nursery and spawning ground
for commercially important fishes and agricultural resources. It is a known fact that
peatlands have been exploited for intensive agriculture such as the ill-fated mega rice
project in Indonesia. In terms of valuable attributes, peatland ecosystem supports a wide
range of biological diversity and a refuge of rare and threatened species that can only be

found in this type of ecosystem. Peatlands are also the subject of a lot scientific researches.

Drivers of peatland degradation

Despite the numerous ecosystem services peatlands offer, they are at great risk of

degradation because of anthropogenic interventions. A study conducted by Dohong et.al
(2017) cited that logging, development of industrial plantations, drainage, and periodic
fires are the primary causes of peatland degradation in South-East Asia. Drainage and peat
extraction cause CO: release to the atmosphere due to soil decomposition and declined

productivity of vegetation (Lucchese et al., 2010; Schulte et al., 2019). When organic soils

120 concentrations

are drained, they release CHs in a relatively lower amount but CO and
are increased (Veber et al., 2018). According to Wetlands International, key drivers of

peatland deterioration include drainage (grazing, agriculture, industrial plantation),

deforestation (legal and illegal logging), fire, weak governance (lack of awareness and
coherent policies) and poverty (limited development options). Threats to peatland stability
include deforestation, drainage and fire owing to human activities (Hooijer et al., 2010). A
study in Malaysia revealed that conversion of peatland to oil palm plantation reduces
organic matter content in the first 2 years of activities (Cooper et al., 2019a).

The land cover changes from 1990 to 2015 in the peatlands of Peninsular Malaysia,
Sumatra and Borneo were analyzed by Miettinen et al. (2016) and found out that peatland
deforestation, as one of the identified drivers of degradation, continued throughout these
years. Results showed that there was 76% (11.9 Mha) peatland cover in 1990, reduced to
41% (6.4 Mha) in 2007 and 29% (4.6 Mha) in 2015.

Damages to the peatland ecosystem because of various land management practices
as discussed by Marsden & Ebmeier (2012) consist of the following: pollution, drainage,
grazing, afforestation, establishment of wind farms, cutting or peat extraction and burning.

In Indonesia, the forested peatlands are degraded by the following anthropogenic
disturbances: logging activities, human resettlement, conversion of peatlands to different
plantations, and development of smallholder agriculture (Surahman, Soni, & Shivakoti,
2018b).

Miettinen, Shi, & Liew (2012) documented the decline on the peat swamp forest
cover in South East Asian archipelago over the last two decades from 1990-2010 which
can be attributed mainly to deforestation and fires in South East Asian peatlands. Original
land cover maps from years 1990, 2000 and 2010 were used in land cover classifications.
It was also mentioned that the Philippines or the islands of Java and Sulawesi were not

included in the analysis as there are no major peatlands in these areas. Deforestation rates

from 1990-2010 in Peninsular Malaysia dropped from 44.3% to 26.9%; Borneo’s peat
swamp cover of 82% was decreased to 45.7%; Sumatra’s decrease of forest cover was from
75.8% to as low as 27.8%. Tallying the decline of peat swamp forest cover by country,
data revealed that Indonesia (except Papua) decreased its peat swamp forest cover from
78.7% to 37.7% while Malaysia had 65.9% in 1990 and left with only 26.1% by 2010. The
average annual rate of deforestation (3.7% y”!) has remained at a high level over the two
consecutive decades. Changes in land-cover patterns were seen as the major contributor
for the deforestation. A large portion accounting to 75% of the degraded peatlands has
been invaded by secondary regrowth while other areas were converted to plantations.
Other factors affecting deforestation include the increase in the proportion of open land,
fire episodes, logging activities and major plantation developments like the Mega Rice
Project in Indonesia. Due to these anthropogenic activities, South East Asian peatlands are
emitting large amounts of Carbon in the atmosphere. Due to peat decomposition, this
sensitive ecosystem is at a higher risk of fire occurrences emitting additional carbon
dioxide which may lead to biodiversity loss or possible extinction.

Threats to peatland ecosystems in many parts of the world according to Ramirez
(2013) are forest fires, logging, drainage, agriculture and deforestation. PAWB-DENR
(2009) in the Philippines listed the conversion of peatlands to agriculture, land clearance
activities, peatland’s classification as alienable and disposable (A&D), continued issuance
of Certificate of Land Ownership Agreements (CLOAs) by the Department of Agrarian
Reform (DAR) and large scale development projects like irrigation as threats to this

important ecosystem


Initiatives in conserving peatlands

Realizing the effects of these main drivers in the declining status of peatlands,
various efforts were made to ensure their conservation. For one, the ASEAN Peatland
Management Initiatives (APMI) was developed by ASEAN in 2003 to promote sustainable
management of peatlands in the ASEAN region. Under the APMI, the ASEAN Peatland
Management Strategy (APMS) 2006-2020 has been developed to guide the countries to
sustainably manage peatlands and reduce fires and associated haze within the framework
of the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution (The ASEAN Secretariat,
2013; Nurhidayah, Lipman, & Alam, 2014). This Agreement was conceptualized to
address transboundary haze pollution due to peatland forest fires to be mitigated through
national efforts and international cooperation (ASEAN Haze Action Online, 2019). The
ASEAN Programme on Sustainable Management of Peatland Ecosystems 2014-2020
(APSMPE), a long-term multi-stakeholder programme, was likewise developed in
September 2013 by the ASEAN Ministers with the objective of promoting sustainable
management of peatlands in the ASEAN region (ASEAN, 2013).

In Southeast Asia, the multi-stakeholder Peatland Management Strategy was
implemented through the initiative of the ASEAN Peatland Forests Project (APFP) with
the aim of reducing the degradation rate of peatlands to lessen the risk of fire and
transboundary haze (IUCN, 2017).

In the Philippines, the then Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau of the Department
of Environment and Natural Resources (PAWB-DENR). now Biodiversity Management

Bureau (BMB), developed a National Action Plan for the Sustainable Use and Protection

of Philippine Peatlands which is within the framework of the ASEAN Peatland
Management Strategy (APMS). This action plan principally aims to develop sustainable
peatland management strategies in coordination with the concerned agencies and
collaborating partners (PAWB-DENR, 2009). Such action plan was also included in the
5" National Report to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), where Philippines is
a signatory, prepared by the DENR-BMB in 2014 (DENR- Protected Areas and Wildlife
Bureau, 2014).

Although the Philippines is not a huge emitter of greenhouse gases, the country
became one of the members who ratified the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty that
targets the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. It emerged from the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) during the Earth Summit in 1992.

The very recent initiative of the Philippines in combating climate change was the
concurrence to the Paris Agreement that aims to keep the average temperature rise this
century to well below 2°C over pre-Industrial Revolution levels, which was signed by
President Rodrigo R. Duterte on 28 February 2017. The country pledged a 70% reduction

on carbon emissions by 2030.

Studies conducted on peatland ecosystem in South East Asia

Vegetation and wildlife

The use of native tree species such as Shorea balangeran (kahoi), Alstonia
pneumatophore (pulai), Dacryodes rostrate (kembajau), Dyera polyphylla (jelutung)

and Campnosperma squamatum (tumbus) were studied by the group of Lampela,

Jauhiainen, Sarkkola, & Vasander (2018) in restoring severely degraded peatland areas in
Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Due to its great performance, Shorea balangeran was
recommended for reforestation. Campnosperma squamatum, on the other hand, showed
very poor performance.

The peat swamp forest vegetation in Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and
the Philippines are represented by tree families of Euphorbiaceae, Myrtaceae, Lauraceae,
Clusiaceae, Rubiaceae and Dipterocarpaceae. Members of Pandanaceae and Nepenthaceae
(pitcher plants) were also observed in the peatland areas (Wésten, J.H.M., Rieley, J.O. and
Page, 2008).

The regrowth of woody plants in the deforested Mega Rice Project area in Central
Kalimantan, Indonesia was surveyed by Blackham, Webb, & Corlett (2014). They counted
and identified individual woody plants 0.5 m in height and grouped a total of 6085 and
2720 woody plants with heights between 0.5-3 m and >3 m, respectively. They also
noticed that most of these woody species are wind-dispersed species (dominated by
Combretocarpus rotundatus) which were possibly dispersed by species of bulbuls under
the Pycnonotidae family and other small to medium-sized birds.

The consequences of habitat loss and peatland degradation particularly on avifaunal
diversity in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia was studied by Posa (201 1) considering various
habitats like intact logged forest, degraded forest fragment and non-forest regrowth. It was
found out that species richness was highest and species composition was significantly
different in intact forest compared to degraded fragment and non-forested area. Bird

species classified as nectarivore and tree foliage-gleaning insectivore were observed to be

dominant at the intact forest but their abundance dropped outside this kind of habitat, The
non-forest regrowth, on the other hand, was dominated by the yellow vented bulbul.

In Talacogon and La Paz, Agusan del Sur, parts of the Agusan Marsh Protected
Area, Philippines, floristic and avifaunal assessments were conducted by Pasicolan et.al
from 2014-2016 (unpublished). Some of the peatland-associated species were Lumbia
(Metroxylon sagu) under Family Palmae, Putat (Barringtonia racemose) which belongs to
Family Barringtoniaceae, and Bangkal (Nauclea orientalis) under Family Rubiaceae.
While these species were present in the area, grasses and sedges like tambo (Phragmites
sp.), talahib (Saccharum spontaneum L.) and cogon (Imiperata cylindrica (L) Beauv.) of
about 2-3 meters tall dominated the area, Other tree communities present in the area were
critically endangered smooth narra (Prerocarpus indicus Willd forma indicus) and mango
(Mangifera sp). Katmon (Dillenia philippinensis Rolfe) an endemic species and a native
species-Smooth Narra (Plerocarpus indicus Willd.) are the two threatened species
observed. The former is classified as vulnerable species under International Union for
Conservation of Nature (IUCN) while the latter is classified as Critically Endangered
species.

These commonly observed bird species observed in the peatlands of Agusan del
Sur are categorized as Least Concern under IUCN: Large-billed crow (Corvus enca),
Balicassiao (Dicrurus balicassius), Sunbird (Nectarinia sp.), Flycatcher (Empidonax sp.),
White-collared Kingfisher (Halycon chloris), Wandering whistling duck (Dendrocygna
arcuate), Philippine duck (Anas Iuzonica), Gallinule (Gallinula sp.), Little Egret (Egretta

garzetta), Philippine coucal (Centropus virdis), Zebra dove (Geopelia striata), Cattle Egret

(Bubulcus ibis), Glossy Swiflet (Collacalia esculenta), Common Moorhen (Gallinula
chlorupus) and Olive backed sunbird (Nectarinia jugularis). Majority of the birds observed
in the area are carnivores and insectivores while only one was omnivore.

‘Also in the Province of Agusan del Sur, Philippines specifically in Caimpugan peat
swamp forest, the vascular plants found herein were studied by Aribal & Fernando (2014).
Based on the rapid assessment conducted in 2010, fieldworks in 2011 and site visit in 2013,
they have listed 101 species belonging to 56 families and 81 genera. The most dominant
tree species and understory vegetation observed were Tristaniopsis micrantha and
Thoracostachyum sumatranum, respectively. They also recorded endangered species like
Hoya crassicaulis and Huperzia squarrosa as well as vulnerable species which include
Asplenium nidus and Myrmecodia tuberosa. Rubiaceae was the recoded family with the
highest taxa comprising 5 genera and 5 species while Apocynaceae family had only | genus
with 4 species.

The vegetation cover of Sungai Karang forest reserve, a part of the peatland dome
in, North Selangor, Malaysia were described by the group of Dhandapani, Ritz, Evers, &
Sjdgersten (2019) as composed of the following: Macaranga pruinosa, Campnosperma
coriaceum, Blumeodendron tokbrai, Shorea platycarpa, Parartocarpus venenosus, Ixora
grandiflora, Pternandra galeata , Stenoclaena palustris, Asplenium longissimum,
Nephrolepsis biserrata, Crytostachys sp., Cyperus rotundus , and Pandanus atrocarpus
They also characterized the vegetation cover of the primary forest of Terengganu Setiu
peat swamp forest in Peninsular Malaysia. Tree species observed were Antisoptera sp.,

Shorea sp., Calophyllum sclerophyllum, Calophylum sp., Blumeondendron tokbrai, Durio

carinatus, Gonystylus bancanus, Elateriospermum tapos, and Syzgium sp. Secondary peat
swamp forest trees are Macaranga pruinosa and Macaranga gigantean. Common
understory vegetation include Pandanus helicopus (palms), Nepenthes ampullaria (pitcher
plants) and Stenocleaena palustris (fern)

Mirmanto (2014) did a vegetation analysi

in Sebangau peat-swamp forest, Central
Kalimantan in Indonesia. The study revealed 133 species of trees belonging to 34 families
of which were dominated by Dipterocarpaceae, Clusiaceae, Myrtaceae and Sapotaceae.
The most dominant species recorded were Combretocarpus rotundatus, Palaquium
leiocarpum, Stemonurus scorpioides and Tristania whittiana.

Ina study on the nature and management of peat swamp forest in Thailand authored
by Nuyim (retrieved from the Proceedings of the International Symposium on Tropical
Peatlands, 2000), the floristic composition of the peat swamp forests found in the Southem
part and South East Coast of Tailand was cited where 109 families and 437 species of
flowering plants and 15 families and 33 species of ferns were discovered. Dominant tree
species in primary peat swamp forest were Syzygium pyrifolium, Ganua motleyana,
Campnosperma coriaceum, Macaranga pruinosa, Calophyllum teysmannii, Neesia

malayana, Endiandra macrophylla, Syzygium obatum, Sterculia bicolor, Stermonurus

secumdiflorus, Syzygium muelleri, and Baccaurea bracteata while Melaleuca cajuputi and

Macaranga pruinosa dominated the secondary peat swamp forests. For wild faunal
inventory, 17 species, 50 species, 196 species, and 62 species of amphibians, reptiles, birds
and mammals were listed. There were rare and endangered species of animals that were

known to only be found in the peat swamp forests and this includes flat-headed cat (Felis

planiceps), otter civet (Cynogale bennetti), and grey-headed fish-eagle (Ichthyophaga
ichthyaetus).

Siregar and Sambas (retrieved from the Proceedings of the International
Symposium on Tropical Peatlands, 2000) established a 1.05~ha study area to assess the
floristic composition of peat swamp forest in Mensemat-Sambas, West Kalimantan in
February 1993. They listed 115 species of trees that were more than 2 cm in diameter and
belonged to 74 genera and 35 families with density of 5741 trees/ha. The recorded tree
species with more than 10 cm dbh was 86 belonging to 58 genera and 31 families with
density of 698 trees/ha while 100 species belonging to 67 genera, 33 families and with
density of 5043 trees/ha were listed under small tree having 2 - 9.9-cm diameter.
Euphorbiaceae, Annonaceae and Dipterocarpaceae were noted to be the most diverse
families while Blumeodendron elatriospermum, Cyatocalyx biovulatus, Blumeodendron
tokbrai, Lithocarpus encleisacarpus and Syzygium chlorantha were the most abundant

trees with 47, 39, 32, 30 and 30 trees/ha, respectively.

Peat soil’s physical and chemical properties

The physico-chemical properties of peat soil such as pH, temperature, bulk density,
organic matter, soil moisture content and C & N contents under different oil palm cropping
systems in North Selangor, Malaysia were examined by Dhandapani, Ritz, Evers, &
Sjdgersten (2019). The following were their study sites: Forest located at the edge of the
Sungai Karang Forest Reserve and the rest of the sites were small-scale agricultural
plantations which they described as 1* generation oil palm mono-cropping (1"' gen OP);

cleared agricultural site (cleared); 2 generation oil palm and yam intercropping (Yam

intercropping); 2" generation oil palm and pineapple intercropping (Pineapple
intercropping) and 2 generation oil palm mono-cropping (2"! gen OP) found at the edge
of Raja Musa Forest Reserve. The sampling periods were from November 2016-January
2017 to represent the wet season and July 2017 for the dry season. Results showed an
approximately 10% reduction in organic matter content from forest to 1* gen OP but
around 50% reduction was observed in the 2" gen OP in both wet and dry seasons. Both
cleared agricultural site and pineapple intercropping had ~90% organic content while both
1* gen OP and yam intercropping had the same level of organic matter content which was
approximately 80% for both seasons. Moisture content was highest during wet season at
the pineapple intercropping but lowest during dry season at the 2" gen OP. pH levels in
all sites varied with the highest (~4.0) and lowest (less than 3.0) values observed at the 2
gen OP and cleared site, respectively, during dry period. Peat soil temperatures were high
in all sites with the highest temperature observed during dry periods at the 1* gen OP and
yam intercropping while lowest temperature for both seasons of study was exhibited by the
forest site. High bulk density of around 5 g/cm? was demonstrated by the 2 gen OP,
followed by both 1°" gen OP and yam intercropping (>0.3 g/ cm’), cleared and pineapple
intercropping (>0.2 g/ cm?) and forest with the lowest BD of <0.2 g/ cm’. For the mean
carbon content (%), a decreasing trend was observed from the cleared agricultural site
(64.1 £2.53), pineapple intercropping (60.2+2.36), Ist gen OP (5141.4), forest
(48.9 1.29), Yam (46.3 + 2.91) and 2nd gen OP (26.4 £ 1.65). For the mean Nitrogen
content (%), forest, pineapple intercropping and cleared site almost had the same N level
(2.4740.11, 2.2740.16 & 2.1340.19) as well as Ist gen OP and yam intercropping

(1.97 0.06 & 1.49 + 0.07). 2nd gen OP showed the lowest mean N content of 0.83 + 0.07.


Sand from the second layer of peat swamp found in Palangka Raya, Central
Kalimantan, Indonesia was collected by Tokura et. al (retrieved from the Proceedings of
the International Symposium on Tropical Peatlands, 2000) for the analysis of its contents.
Using X-ray fluorescence analysis, 100% purity of SiO2 compound was discovered which
comprised of 46.74% silicon and 53.26% oxygen. A contaminant in the form of titanium
was also found in the sand that contains 4.13 wt% of silicon, 54.65 wt% of titanium and
41.22 w1% of oxygen.

‘The status of Boron (B), along with other soil chemical compositions, in the tropical
peat soils in southern Thailand, southern Peninsular Malaysia, and Sarawak, Malaysia were
given by Yonebayashi & Yamada (retrieved from the Proceedings of the International
Symposium on Tropical Peatlands, 2000). Mean Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P) and
Potassium (K) contents showed a decreasing trend with soil depth while Calcium (Ca) and
Magnesium (Mg) had very low contents but found to be almost constant with soil depth.
Mean contents of Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), Zinc (Zn), and Copper (Cu) also showed

very low contents and steady values with soil depth. Two methods in extracting Boron

from the peat soils were done, i.c., thru hot water extraction and mannitol-acetate
extraction. Mean B content from the surface soil (0-20 cm depth) was 0.26 mg kg"'for both
extraction types. At 20-40 cm depth, mannitol-acetate extraction got a higher mean B
content of 0.12 mg kg" compared to 0.07 mg kg’! from hot water extraction. Lower mean
B content was observed in deeper soil layer (40-60 cm), 0.02 mg kg" and 0.10 mg kg?
from hot water and mannitol-acetate extractions, respectively.

Sayok, Nik, Melling, Samad, & Efransjah (2007) and Melling, Joo, Uyo, Sayok, &

Hatano (2007) reported the soil chemical properties of three different forest types in the

peatlands of Loagan Bunut National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia namely mixed swamp forest
(MSF), alan forest (AF) and padang alan forest (PA). They studied both the surface (0-25
cm depth) and sub-surface (25-50 cm depth) soil layers. pH ranged from 3.52-3.78 at the
three forest types, %C was found to be highest (51.42%) and lowest (37.44%) in soil sub-
surface of PA and soil surface of MSF, respectively. %N did not differ significantly across
sites that ranged from 1.03-1.94%, Ca (c mol kg-1), Mg (c mol kg-1), K (c mol kg-1) and
Na (c mol kg-1) at the three sites ranged from 0.58-1.08, 0.77-2.72, 0.05-0.39 and 0.21-
0.43, respectively. Available P varied significantly across sites as the highest mean was
found to be 60.29 ppm from the soil surface of MSF while the lowest value of 21.41ppm
was from soil sub-surface of AF. Ranges of the following soil properties from the different
sites were: Fe (17-69-115.93 ppm), Mn (2.23-8.36 ppm), Cu (1.34-10.15 ppm), Zn (11.14-
41.85 ppm) and Hot Water B (0.49-1.31 ppm).

A 1.05-ha study area was established by Siregar and Sambas (retrieved from the
Proceedings of the International Symposium on Tropical Peatlands, 2000) to assess the
floristic composition of peat swamp forest in Mensemat-Sambas, West Kalimantan in
February 1993 but they also did a quantitative analysis of some physico-chemical
properties of peat soil within the study area. Peat depth considered was between 1900 cm
— 4000 cm. Since peat soils are by nature waterlogged, water content was found to be
between 153.8 %-448.7 %, pH levels between 2.4-3.6, C-organic content ranged from 51.2
%- 57.0%, N-total between 0.73% - 1.90%, P-available ranged between 3.19% - 26.20%.
Levels of exchangeable cations that include Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg), Potassium
(K) and Sodium (Na) were also determined with values that ranged between 2.78 ~ 11.04

me/100g, 4.24 - 10.11 me/100g, 0.12 ~ 0.80 me/100g, 0.11 ~ 2.76 me/100g, respectively.

Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) was between 208.5 — 277.2 me/100g while Aluminum

(Al) ranged from 1.07 — 8.69 me/100g.

Carbon stocks

Alibo (2011) studied the aboveground and belowground carbon storage of the
5,487-ha Caimpugan, Agusan del Sur in the Philippines. In measuring the carbon stocks,
the author had considered three (3) vegetation zones (tall pole forest, intermediate forest
and pygmy forest). Results revealed that the C stock in peat soil (4,659 tC ha") was higher
than all the aboveground C stocks (53 tC ha'') combined for all the three vegetation zones.
This means that unlike other forest types where aboveground C has the highest C stock
among the pools, peatlands stored huge amount of C in the soil.

Taberima, Djuuna, Musaad, & Murdiyarso (2018) quantified the belowground
carbon stocks in Eastern Indonesia particularly the peatland areas of Papua and West Papua
Provinces and found out that C stocks varied across the study sites with amount that ranged
from 1196.30 to 1774.70 Mg ha’, The total carbon stock accordingly was observed to be
remarkably higher compared to the other forest types

The influence of rainfall during dry and wet seasons on soil carbon quality in
Southeast Asia, particularly where oil palm conversions were widespread, was examined
by Adeolu et al., (2015). They observed a comparatively lower soil carbon content during
dry periods. In year 2000, the lowest soil carbon content recorded during dry season at 1.5
meter depth was 45.97% as against 51.76% which was the highest value logged for the wet

season. The 2010 observations showed that the lowest soil carbon content at 0.5 meter

depth was 32.87% during the dry season while a higher value of 39.46% was recorded in
wet season.

Using a combination of empirical peat depth model and GIS, carbon stock
distribution below the ground of peatland of Industrial Forest Plantation that covers about
454,589 hectares in South Sumatera, Indonesia was assessed. Carbon stock of
belowground peatland was approximately 310 Mt which was computed at varying peat
depth. They came up with the following carbon stock estimations: very shallow (<0.5m)
= 27 Mt, shallow (0.5-Im) = 14 Mt, moderate (2m) = 20 Mt, deep (3m) = 45 Mt and very
deep (>3m) = 203 Mt (Rudiyanto et al., 2015).

Padmanabhan, Eswaran, & Reich (2013) studied the carbon stocks of various soil
types in Sarawak, Malaysia. These are the different soil types that were mapped in the
area: Oxisols which have highly weathered soil materials; Ultisols or upland soils; Entisols

wherein the parent rock is found below 0.25 m from the soil surface; Inceptisols which

have gleyed horizons within 0.50 m from the soil surface and the Histosols or the peat soils.

Among the soil types studied, histosols had the highest estimate of carbon content (109.31

kg C m? m") followed by oxisols (20.60 kg C m? m”'), ultisols (16.95 kg C m? m"),
entisols (9.51 kg C m? m'') and inceptisols (6.51 kg C m™ m”'). Since histosols store
large amount of carbon, it should be cleared whether this fragile type of soil is a carbon

sink or source of carbon emission.


Water table

A study conducted by Marwanto et al (2019) proved that high water table will
suppress CO2 emissions from peatlands. The relationship of peat (soil) and water in
degraded and intact peatland in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia was also studied by Wsten,
Clymans, Page, Rieley, & Limin (2008). They detected fires in areas with deep
groundwater levels while intact peatland was proved to be fairly resilient and less
susceptible to fire. Using the annual precipitation for years 1994-2004 for the
hydropedological model, it revealed that 1997 was the driest year with 1,848mm rainfall
in contrast to the wettest year’s (1999) 3,788mm rainfall. With model calibration and
validation, it showed that 40% of the study area had calculated groundwater levels lower
than the critical threshold of 40cm during the El Nifto year in 1997, When the groundwater
level falls below 40 cm from peat surface, the moisture content drops to about 0.90 cm?
making it susceptible to fire.

The hydrological disruptions in peatland ecosystems and its possible contribution
to wildfires was studied by Kettridge et al. (2015). By doing a long-term experiment that
involved moderate drainage and wildfire, they discovered that a moderate drop in water
table increases the vulnerability of peatlands to fires. These peatland disturbances led to
the conversion of moss-dominated peatland to non-carbon forming shrubland-grassland
ecosystems which are more prone to fires, thereby, increasing the risk of stored carbon
depletion

A study conducted by Jauhiainen, Limin, Silvennoinen, & Vasander (2008)

discovered that subsidence and emissions of COz is higher when water table level is

lowered that causes peat oxidation. Ritzema et al. (2014) mentioned that in Central
Kalimantan, Indonesia, CO? emissions are reduced with increased water table to above ~
0.2 m of the undrained peat surface. Contrarily, lower water tables hasten CO2 emission
and subsidence in drained peatlands.

Susilo, Yamamoto, & Imai (2013) modelled the groundwater level fluctuations
under the effect of El Nifio phenomenon in areas between Sebangau River and Kahayan
River, Central Kalimantan Province in Indonesia where the Mega Rice Project was
established. ‘They recognized that the conversion of peatlands to agriculture following
drainage causes the reduction of water table level in peat soils. Consequently, the
construction of drainage canals made the peat soils more prone to fires. Monitoring the
behavior of ground water, thus, should be done which they have initiated through
groundwater modelling. Such model was used to simulate the level of groundwater during
ENSO years of 1997 and 2002. The very noticeable observation that they have made was
the positioning of the groundwater below the ground level for more than 3 months that
resulted in negative water balance. This also can be attributed to the low precipitation level
during the observation periods. Also included in the simulation was the prevention of
peatland fires wherein the water table should not be lower than 40cm from the peat surface.
In such an event, moisture content decreases which humidifies the top layer of the peat
leading to fires that could spread so quickly because of the dry peat soil.

Shimada et. al (retrieved from the Proceedings of the International Symposium on
Tropical Peatlands, 2000) classified 5 different peatland types as follows: riverine, terrace,
basin/domed, marginal and coastal in Central Kalimantan and coastal peatlands in Sumatra

and West Kalimantan, Indonesia. By multiplying the bulk density (BD) and carbon content

(CC) of each sample collected from different sites, the mean volumetric C density (CDy,
kg m7) per peatland type was calculated. In decreasing order, terrace had the highest CDy
of 71.5 + 17.3 kg m®, followed by riverine (64.5 + 14.0 kg m), basin/domed (55.8 + 8.7

kg m?), marginal (53.6 + 12.5 kg m*) and coastal with the lowest CDy of 48.7 + 6.3 kg m”


Peatland fires

Water-soluble ions and some chemical elements in PMzs (fine particulate matter
with diameters that are normally 2.5 micrometers and smaller) from peatland fires occurred
in Riau Province, Sumatra, Indonesia were characterized by the team of Fujii, Huboyo,
Tohno, Okuda, & Syafrudin (2019). For all the samples collected from the peatland fires,
CI’ and NH4* were the dominant anions and cations that were consistently observed.

In Petaling Jaya, Malaysia, PMz s was quantified during southwest monsoon (June
September) season. They discovered that on the average, 51-55% of the total
PM2s concentration was coming from Indonesian peatland fires (IPFs). Such poses risks
to human health, visibility that may affect transport and regional climate in Southeast Asian
countries (Fujii, Tohno, Amil, & Latif, 2017).

In Brunei Darussalam, a 6-yr study was conducted by Dotse, Dagar, Petra, & De
Silva, (2016) to quantify the PMio concentration as influenced by the Southeast Asian haze.
They saw a clear pattern of variations on the PMioconcentrations with the highest recorded
concentrations during the southwest monsoon season when biomass burning was being

done in Indonesia (particularly in the peatlands of Sumatra and Kalimantan) to prepare the

land for agricultural purposes, thus transporting huge amounts of particles and pollutants
to the atmosphere.

The fire-affected peatland areas planted with timber and oil palm in Sumatra
(624,000 has), Kalimantan (1,100,000 has) and West Papua (400,000 has) between 1997
and 1998 were discussed by Tacconi, Moore, & Kaimowitz (2007). A total of 2,124,000
has of burnt peat swamp forest became the local source of smoke haze that affected the
environment and the health of an estimated 35 million people due to pollution beyond the
normal level

The occurrence of extensive peatland forest fires and the corresponding release of
carbon in Central Kalimantan, Borneo during the 1997 El Nifto was assessed by Page,
Susan, E.Limin, Jaya, Siegert, Rieley, & Boehm (2002) using satellite images. Results
showed that 32% (0.79 Mha) of the 2.5 million hectare-study area was burnt of which
91.5% (0.73 Mha) was peatland. The amount of carbon released to the atmosphere was
estimated to be around 0.19-0.23 gigatonnes (Gt) and 0.05 Gt owing to peat combustion
and burning of vegetation covering the area, respectively. Using these figures, they
extrapolated an estimate of carbon emissions for the whole of Indonesia which was
between 0.81 and 2.57 Gt of carbon that resulted from peat and vegetation burning. Such
amount is equivalent to 13-40% of the mean annual global carbon emissions from fossil
fuels that caused an increased concentration of atmospheric CO: from 1957 records.

The same fire occurrence in Kalimantan and Sumatra, Indonesia in 1997 was
surveyed by Levine (1999) focusing on gaseous and particulate emissions. Using SPOT
images, the estimated total area burnt during this peat wildfire was 45,600 km? due to land

clearing activities and land use changes while the emissions of CO: (1.28x10° vs. 5.0 x10°

Mt C), CO (2.19x10° vs 4.4x10? Mt C), CHs (1.23x10* vs 1.5x10? Mt C), NOx (3.93x10*
vs 2.0x10 Mt N), and particulate (1.08x10° vs 1.2x10* Mt) were calculated to be
exceedingly higher than the 1991 Kuwait oil fires.

‘This 1997-1998 forest fires in Indonesia reached as far as Philippines, Sri Lanka
and Australia not to mention the neighboring countries such as Malaysia and Singapore
that were greatly affected by this disaster. The estimates for the burnt area in East
Kalimantan alone ranged from 180,000 to 240,000 hectares. The fires caused severe
regional health problems affecting more than 70 million people covering six countries as
the Air Pollution Index exceeded 800 particularly in Kuching and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
and Singapore. The projected total losses was around $5-6 billion taking into account the
loss of timber, biodiversity, and plantations including the long-term health effects that led

to major economic failures (retrieved from https://rainforests. mongabay.com).

The use of closed-chamber method in measuring soil fluxes

The use of closed-chamber method, particularly the soil flux gas system with
infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) has become a more popular field technique in measuring
greenhouse gas emissions. For the purpose of providing more details on studies conducted
in the field using Lior 8100A which was the same equipment used in this thesis study,
results of four related researches were discussed fully as follows.

Castillo, Apan, Maraseni, & Salmo (2017) used LiCor-8100A Automated Soil COr
Flux System in measuring soil COz, CHs and N2O fluxes in a mangrove forest and non-

forest land uses on deforested mangrove areas in the coasts of Honday Bay, Palawan,

Philippines. Following the manufacturer’s manual, in-situ CO fluxes were measured
while trace gas samples were collected from the gas sampling kit attached to the LiCor
instrument for the analyses of CHs and N20. These gas samples were brought to IRRI
Laboratory for the analyses of GHG concentrations. Results revealed that CO2 and CH:
emissions were higher but NzO emissions were lower in mangrove forests compared to the
non-forest land uses.

The respiration rates of mineral soils located at the semi-field facility at Aarhus
University, Foulum in Denmark were measured by Kandel, Lerke, & Elsgaard (2016)
using Li-Cor 8100 closed chamber combined with a LI-8100 IRGA. In measuring the soil
respiration fluxes, samples of sandy clay loam and sandy loam mineral soils and an organic
peat soils were taken. The mineral soils were collected from a semi-field facility in
Foulum, Denmark while peat soils were taken from the largest peat raised bog area in Store
Vildmose, Denmark. Taking into consideration various manipulations and simulations that
include tillage, rain and drought, different soil types and soil conditions, researchers
obtained gas flux ranges and curves. Linear method accordingly provided the most stable
soil fluxes when measured with short chamber enclosure time. On the contratry, longer
enclosure time led to the underestimation of CO2, CHs and N:O fluxes.

A series of field measurement set-ups at Cook Agronomy Farm near Pullman,
Washington from 2012-2015 made use of closed chamber systems (Li-Cor 8100A) to
monitor the changes in the concentrations of CO and NO at the no-till winter wheat and
canola agricultural sites. This automatic soil flux system allows the measurement of high

resolution data for gas emissions such that of CO; and N20 fluxes from soil to the

atmosphere (Kostyanovsky, Huggins, Stockle, Waldo, & Lamb, 2018). Results reflected
the effect of COz and N20 emissions at the no-till winter wheat site where an increase in
soil moisture and soil temperature were observed during the fall/winter and spring months,
respectively. The authors concluded that the high-resolution data of automatic chamber
led to annual emission values of CO2 and N20 which were comparable to the measurements
using manual chambers.

An automated closed chamber with an infrared gas analyser (L1-8100) was used by
Fiener, DlugoB, Korres, & Schneider (2012) in determining the spatial variability of soil
respiration of sugar beet and winter wheat fields at a test site in North Rhine-Westphalia,
Germany over three crop cycles from 2008-2009. An analysis was done on the effects of
differences on the following environmental variables: soil moisture and temperature,
erosional and depositional status as well as plant and soil properties. On soil respiration,
results revealed that the effects of spatial differences in soil moisture and temperature were
minimal. Furthermore, the variations in both median grain size and bulk density proved to
be constantly effecting soil respiration. Generally, in most phases of measurement, there
was less respiration at erosional compared to depositional sites.

‘A number of researchers also used other types of LiCor equipment for soil gas
fluxes and they were enumerated as follows:

Rankin, Strachan, & Strack (2018) used LiCor-7500A in measuring carbon dioxide
(CO2) and methane (CH4) exchange in unrestored peatland in Saint-Alexandre-de-

Kamouraska region, Quebec, Canada.


Itoh et al. (2017) calculated CO> efflux in the peatlands of Central Kalimantan,
Indonesia by employing a closed-chamber method with portable infrared gas analyzer
(GMP343).

GHG emissions of drained agricultural peat soils in Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta
in California, USA, on the other hand, were measured using LI-7500 A for CO2 and HO
and LI-7700 for CHs fluxes (Hemes et al., 2019).

LiCor-8100A infrared gas analyzer with a 20 cm diameter survey chamber was also
used in measuring CO> efflux from soil respiration in the greater Boston, USA considering
15 sites under forest, lawn, and landscaped urban areas (Decina et al., 2016).

Closed chamber (Licor 820 IRGA) was the instrument used in quantifying the
seasonal variability of CO2 fluxes in a mature Rhizophora-dominated mangrove forest
found in Can Gio, Viet Nam (Vinh, Allenbach, Joanne, & Marchand, 2019).

A portable soil CO> flux system (LI-COR 6100) was used by Mitchell et al. (2016)
in measuring the concentrations of CO2, CHs and N20 of agricultural soils at Samford
Ecological Research Facility, Samford Valley, Queensland, Australia from September
2013-Septem 2014.

Licor L1-820 with a portable infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) was used in monitoring
the long-term effects of abandoning drained peat soils and fluctuations in CO> fluxes in an
experimental site established in Massaciuccoli Lake basin, Pisa, Italy (Pellegrino et al.,
2015).

The automated chamber measurements of N:O fluxes were carried out in an
agricultural field covering 24 hectares of irrigated maize located in south-west of France

using LI-820 with compact infrared gas analysers (Tallec et al., 2019).


The use Licor 8100 with Infrared Gas Analyser (IRGA) was one of the

methodologies employed in the laboratory simulation and field verification for measuring

soil CO> flux from a proposed Heartland Area Redwater Project (HARP) in Edmonton,
Alberta (Brydie, Faught, Olson, Underwood, & Drozdowski, 2013).

In doing the field measurement on the soil respiration of Singapore tropical

turfgrass found in an urban area, a closed chamber system (IRGA; LI-6252) was used by

Ng et al. (2015) from July to December 2012.

Assessments GHG emissions in tropical and temperate countries

Hooijer et al. (2010) discussed the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from drained
peatlands in Indonesia, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea. However, peatland areas in other
South East Asian countries such as the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam were excluded.
In order to measure the CO2 emissions from these sites, they considered some information
such as groundwater depth for the drainage class where ground water depth for large-scale
plantations was assumed to be 0.95m, small-scale agriculture between 0.4-08m while
recently cleared and burnt peatlands have water depth of approximately 0.25-0.4m. The
relationship between ground water depth and CO: emission was also determined. A linear
relationship was expressed which means that every 10cm water table drawdown will result
in an increase in CO> emission rate of 9.1 1 COz h'! y'. Another important information
was the carbon content of Southeast Asian peat was taken to be 60 kg m *. Results revealed
that about 12.9Mha or about 47% of Southeast Asian peatlands were deforested by 2006

of which 2.3Mha of these were drained from large-scale agriculture, 8.5Mha from small-

scale agriculture and 2.3Mha were recently cleared or burnt. The total estimated CO2
emission in 2006 was estimated to be 632 Mt y"!. Indonesia is currently the largest emitter
of COz contributing to 82% of Southeast Asian CO2 emissions in 2006. If current practices
for peatland developments continue without mitigation, the emission was expected to peak
at 745 Mt y" in 2015 but is projected to decline to a value of 514Mt y by 2030 and will
decline further to 236 Mt y' by 2070 due to increasing depletion of peat deposits. The
total cumulative emission from all peatlands in Southeast Asia up to 2006 was estimated
at 9,700 Mt (5,300 Mt- 13,700 Mt) while the total cumulative emissions by 2030 and 2070
are projected to be 25,900 Mt (17,200 Mt-31,000 Mt) and 37,300 Mt (28,900 Mt-39900
Mb), respectively.

The carbon emissions from peat oxidation in 2015 under several land cover types
were examined by Miettinen et al. (1990). Four provinces in Indonesia namely Riau,
South Sumatra, West and Central Kalimantan and Sarawak in Malaysia have been selected
as study sites. They also included carbon emissions from the whole of Sumatra,
Kalimantan and Malaysia. Land cover types considered were degraded peat swamp forest
(PSF), tall shrub/secondary forest, open/undeveloped area; smallholder area, industrial
plantation and urban area. Of these land uses, industrial plantation that represented the
whole of Sumatra emitted the highest carbon content of 36.1 Mt C y"' followed by
smallholder area in the province of Riau with carbon emission value of 21.0 Mt C y".
Another set of calculation was done for years 1990, 2007 and 2015 combining the carbon
emissions per land use from all the study sites. In 1990, smallholder area had the highest
emission of 20.7 Mt C y" followed by degraded PSF (12.1Mt C y). Smallholder area

remained to be the highest emitter in 2007 with an emission value of 40.3 MtC y'' followed

by industrial plantation that emitted 34.2 Mt C y?. In 2015, however, industrial plantation
and smallholder area prevailed to be the land uses with the highest emissions of 64.3Mt C
y' and 49.1Mt C y" respectively.

Ina study conducted by Miettinen, Hooijer, et al. (2012), the extent of large-scale
industrial plantations including oil and pulp plantations on the peatlands of Peninsular
Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo was investigated. Results of the study showed that 3.1Mha
accounting to 20% of the peatlands had been converted to industrial plantations by 2010,
0.8 Mha of which were covered by oil palm plantation. It was also estimated that in 2010,
industrial plantations produced carbon emission to the atmosphere at least 233 Mt yr! COze
or up to 311 Mt yr! COze. These figures accordingly exceeded the total annual carbon
emission from fossil fuel burning of a country like Malaysia. It was emphasized, however,
that industrial plantation is not the only threat to the tropical peatlands but also
deforestation which include secondary regrowth, smallholder plantations and open
clearances. In the study area, only 34% of peatlands remained from 1990's 75%. This
deforestation rate of nearly 4% y"' was generally higher than deforestation levels around
the world.

The oxidative peat decomposition in three sites located in Central Kalimantan,
Indonesia was measured by Itoh et al. (2017) for years 2014-2015. They found out that
ground water level (GWL) is a major environmental factor that controls the peat
decomposition in the sites under study. Sites include an undrained peat swamp forest (UF),
a heavily drained peat swamp forest (DF), and a drained and burned ex-forest (DB).
Results showed that both peat oxidation and mean GWL at all sites increased from 2014 to

2015. In UF (mean GWL from the soil surface: -0.23m & -0.39m), the CO2 emissions for


2014 and 2015 were 698 + 114 g C my"! and 745 + 99 g C my"! respectively; DF
(mean GWL: -0.55m & -0.59m) has CO2 emissions of 775 + 29 gC my"! and 825 + 26
gC my"; DB (mean GWL: -0.22m & -0.62m), on the other hand, emitted CO2 amounts
of 646 + 41 gC my"! and 748 + 37 gC m~y" within the observation periods.

The corresponding carbon losses from peatland conversion to oil palm plantation
over a 25-year rotation was determined by Murdiyarso et al. (2010). Ceasing of peat
accumulation in the forest corresponds to 18.8 + 6.3 Mg C ha’!, burning of peat from land-
clearing activities loses 100.0 + 50.0 Mg C ha'!, change in biomass C stocks and peat C
loss in oil-palm plantation account for 155.5 39.2 and 131.1 + 28.2 Mg C ha",
respectively, totaling to a loss of approximately 405.3 + 69.8 Mg C ha’'. This is equivalent
to 1,486.1 Mg of CO> per hectare over 25 years.

The study on the fluxes of methane (CH,) from peat wetland with a depth between
0.5 to 5 m was conducted by Hargreaves & Fowler (1998) in Caithness, Scotland from
May to June 1994, Methane fluxes were measured using a fast-response tunable diode laser
spectrometer (TDL). Results revealed that the mean CH, emission rate at the site was 39
umol mh’! during the experiment, although peak emission rates up to 170 wmol m? h"!
were observed for short periods of up to | h. It was also found out that wetter areas of the
peatland were consistently producing a larger methane emission as compared to the
emission in drier areas. The researchers also observed consistently higher methane
emissions in the daytime (40 pmol mh!) than at night (30 pmol m?h'). The diurnal
variation on the rates emission as cited in some literatures was due to photosynthetic
activity. The graphs presented in the study also showed a strong direct linear correlation

between soil temperature and methane emission, that is, emission increases with increasing


a
temperature. On the contrary, an increasing water table depth permitted a decreasing
methane emission. A simple model was designed with the assumption that temperature
was maintained at a steady 8.8°C and varying CH, emission by changing water table only.
The total annual emission predicted by the model for this site was 0.43pmol mh" which
is equivalent to 69 kg CHs hay"

The emissions of methane (CHs) in an intensively managed dairy farm and an
extensively managed peatland area in Oukoop and Stein, Netherlands were evaluated by
Schrier-Uijl et al. (2010). Results showed a decreasing trend on annual terrestrial CH,
emissions in intensively managed peat farm in Oukoop from 2006 (203 + 48 kg CHsha™'),
2007 (162 + 60 kg CHaha ') and 2008 (146 + 60 kg CHaha '). The annual terrestrial CHs
emissions in extensively managed peatland area in Stein, however, fluctuated indicating
the following values: 2006 (157 + 63 kg CHa ha™'), 2007 (180 + 54 kg CHa ha™') and 2008
(163 + 59 kg CHs ha"). Water and soil temperatures were found to be the major factors
influencing the CH, emissions in both study sites.

Nitrous oxide (N20) emissions of tropical peatland in three different ecosystems
namely mixed swamp forest, sago plantation and oil palm plantation in Sarawak, Indonesia
were studied Melling, Hatano, & Goh (2007). Various methodologies involved were the
determination of N2O fluxes; determination of N20 concentration in the soil profile; N2O
concentration analysis; identifying environmental variables; soil sampling and analysis and
statistical analysis. Results showed that the N2O emission was highest in the sago
ecosystem with a rate of 3.3 kg Nha ! y ', followed by the oil palm ecosystem at 1.2 kg N

ha! y"' while the forest ecosystem had the lowest rate at 0.7 kg N ha”! y"!. Seasonal

variations in N20 emissions in both the sago and oil palm ecosystems might be associated

with seasonal changes in the water table and soil mineral N while N2O production from the
forest ecosystem was within the range of tropical secondary forest. N20 concentrations
are also influenced by different soil depths.

In Finland, peatland sites under various land uses like forests, cultivated fields,
afforested fields, drained and abandoned fields were examined by Liimatainen et al. (2018)
to assess the variability of nitrous oxide (N20) fluxes. Environmental factors such as C/N
ratio, water table, bulk density and soil phosphorus were considered. Results showed that

in forests, lower water table (-41 cm) emits higher N20 of 1.43 + 0.59 g Nm“ y ' compared

to the emission value of 0.07 + 0.03 gN m7?

with lower WT (-36 em). Cultivated fields
showed opposite results where lower WT (-60 cm) emits higher N20 (2.38#1.49 g N m2
y'') than higher WT (-82 cm) that emits 0.73 + 0.12 gNm ?y ', Afforested and abandoned
fields showed the same trend as that of forests where lower WT emits lower N20 amount
and higher WT with high N2O emission, i.e., 0.07 + 0.07 g N m™ y"! (WT: -25 cm), 2.14
+0.60gN my ! (WT: -52 cm) and 0.41 + 0.17g Nm? y"' (WT; -35 cm), 1.42 + 0.68 g
Nm y"!(WT: -51 cm) respectively. Drained field emits 0.04 gN m= y"!,

The greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO2 and CHs, from the peatlands of
Terengganu primary peat swamp forest and North Selangor secondary forest in Peninsular
Malaysia were measured by Dhandapani, Ritz, Evers, & Sjégersten (2019). Results
showed that secondary forest emitted CO: content which was twice as high (~1000 mg m"
7 hr) as that of the primary forest (< 500 mg m? h'') for both sampling seasons, Both
primary and secondary forests, on the other hand, showed no significant difference in the

CHs emissions for both seasons that was approximately 2 mg mh", The secondary forest

also served as methane sink as it absorbed — 30 pg mh"! and -10 pg mh"! during the
dry and wet seasons, respectively.

The effects of land use changes in the seasonal fluxes of COz, CHs and N20 for a year in
the peatlands of South Kalimantan, Indonesia were calculated by Inubushi, Furukawa,
Hadi, Purnomo, & Tsuruta (2003). Three land use managements were considered in this
study: secondary forest (G3), abandoned paddy field (G2) and abandoned upland crops
field (G1). The conversion of secondary forests to paddy field increased the total COz
emission from 1200 + 430 g C my" to 1540 + 290 g C my" to while secondary forest
conversion to upland crops decreased the total emission from 1200 + 430 g C my to 990
+ 110g C my, Same trend was observed for the total CHs emissions, G3 conversion to
G2 increased emission from 1.2 + 0.4 g C myto 1.9 4 0.5 g C my" while conversion
of G3 to G1 showed a decreased emission from 1.2 + 0.4 g C my" to 0.6 + 0.72 C m*y’
'. N20 emissions at the three sites consistently produced negative values throughout the

duration of the study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Site Description

Bambanin is a barangay in the municipality of Victoria, in the province of Oriental
Mindoro with land area of 546.7 hectares (Barangay Profile, 2019). It is situated at
approximately 13.1196 °N, 121.2922 °E, in the island of Mindoro. Elevation at these
coordinates is estimated at 20.7 meters or 67.9 feet above mean sea level (PhilAtlas, 2019).
Bambanin is approximately 44.7 kilometers away from Calapan Pier, one of the primary
Roro Ports in the island, and 35.9 kilometers away from Calapan Town Proper. It is
bounded on the North by the municipality of Naujan, on the East by Lake Naujan, on the
West by the Sablayan Municipality, and on the South by Socorro Municipality. It has a
population of 1,545 which is composed of 346 households (Barangay Profile, 2019). This

area is accessible by all kinds of land vehicles.

Victoria has a tropical climate. Its average temperature is 27.2 °C while the average
annual rainfall is 2093 mm. March accordingly is the driest month with 39 mm of
precipitation. The site receives the highest precipitation in July with an average of 288
mm. Minimum temperature ranges between 22.6°C-24.6°C while maximum temperature
is between 28,9°C-32.7°C. In the whole year, January has the lowest average temperature
of 25.7°C. May, on the other hand, is the warmest month with an average of 28.6°C. The
rainfall varies 249 mm between the driest and the wettest months. The average

temperatures differ during the year by 2.9 °C (retrieved from https://en,climate-data.org)

Figure 1 shows the administrative boundaries of Brgy. Bambanin, Victoria,

Oriental Mindoro.

Oriental Mindoro

One of the unique features of Bambanin is the presence of peatland, locally known
as “Bulaho” which has an estimated area of 27.59 hectares, approximately 5.05% of the
total land area of Bambanin. This place was previously known as “Tambuan” according
to the community in the area, which means that the common species planted in the area
was Tambo (Phragmites australis) before it was planted with agricultural crops, forest

trees, and fruit trees. Bambanin peatland is part of the Naujan Lake National Park that

covers 21,655 hectares and was declared a protected area on January 25, 1968 by virtue of
Proclamation No. 335. Ten percent (10%) of this protected area was identified as swamp
areas adjacent to the lake. This is now the Bambanin peatland swamp which is
approximately 1.3 kilometers east of Naujan Lake (DENR-MIMAROPA, 2019). The road
access map of Brgy. Bambanin, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro via Calapan City Proper can

be seen in Figure 2.

Biological assessments

Secondary data on existing vegetation and wildlife found in the peatland area were
gathered from the previous study titled “Development of Management Strategies for

Peatlands” implemented by the Ecosystems Research and Development Bureau (ERDB)

in Bambanin, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro from 2014-2016 (Pasicolan, et.al, 2016,

unpublished).

Floristic Survey

Using a meter tape, a transect line was laid out along the slope of the study site to
cover different elevation gradient. In the case of Bambanin, a contiguous transect was used
along the trails for accessibility purpose. To avoid underestimation of biodiversity, the
quadrats were established a few (2-5) meters from the trail. While setting-up the 1-km
transect, 50-m interval was marked with highly visible flagging tape and was marked using
a GPS device.

The modified belt transect method for biodiversity assessment developed by
B+WISER (2014) was further modified for the assessment of flora in peat swamp. A I-km
transect was used with Sm x Sm quadrats for diversity assessment. The ecosystem level
assessment is at every 50-meter interval. Measurements of diameter at breast-height
(DBH) and total height (TH) inside the quadrat were done for trees whose diameter is equal

or greater than 10-cm.

Avi-faunal Assessment

Timed species-count (TSC) method was used per station of an established 2-km
transect in the area. The survey was carried out from 5:30AM to 9:00AM and late in the

afternoon from 3:00PM to 5:00PM. All bird species seen or heard during observation

periods were listed. Using a digital camera with high optical zoom (50x), photos of the
species observed were taken. A recorder and a field guide to Philippine Birds (Kennedy et
al., 2000) were used for bird species identification. Opportunistic sampling was also done.
For ethno-biological accounts, some local folks were interviewed to know the species that
were not captured/recorded during the visual and aural surveys. The birds’ distribution
status and conservation status were determined using the updated International Union for
Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species, Appendices of
Conservation on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna
(CITES), and DENR Administrative Order no. 2004-15 “Establishing the List of Terrestrial
Threatened Species and other Categories, and the List of other Wildlife Species pursuant

to Republic Act no. 9147”.

Physico-chemical assessments

Water quality assessment

In-situ water quality assessment was done using a multiparameter water quality
checker (Aquaread) to measure the following parameters: temperature, pH, dissolved
oxygen (DO), total dissolved solids (TDS), conductivity and salinity (Figure 6). Purposive
sampling with three readings (replicates) from each land use (forestland, cultivated land
and grassland) was done. The deeper parts of the wetland were intentionally selected by

the author as sampling points since the equipment used needs to be fully submerged in the

water for a better measurement. Collection was conducted once during dry and wet
seasons. GPS coordinates of these sampling points were recorded for future data collection

(Appendix 1).

Figure 6. The use of a multiparameter water quality checker (Aquaread) in
measuring the quality of peatland waters (Photos by GHRueda, November
2018).

Soil quality assessment

Soil sampling was carried out on November 15, 2018 (wet season) and March 23,
2019 (dry season). Similar to the water quality assessment, purposive sampling was done
as the sites selected were the most accessible parts of the peatland. Being extremely
waterlogged especially in the wet season, muddy parts of the peatland were ankle-deep to

knee-deep which made the setting-up of equipment and data collection difficult. Using a

soil corer (auger), a depth of 2 meters from each vegetation cover/land use (grassland,
forestland, cultivated land) with four replicates each was taken (Figure 7). The soil samples
were divided into 0-30, 30-75, 75-100, 100-150 and 150-200 cm fractions (5 composite
samples from each vegetation cover, n=15) for the measurements of soil chemical
properties such as pH, NPK and organic matter. The samples were properly labelled and
sealed in ziplock plastic bags and were brought to ERDB Laboratory for the required
analyses. Collection of soil samples was done once during dry and wet seasons, GPS

coordinates of the sampling points were recorded for future data collection (Appendix 1).

Table 2 indicates the various types of laboratory analyses that were performed in

determining the concentrations/contents of the following soil-physico parameters: pH,

Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium and organic matter.

Table 2. Types of laboratory analysis employed at different soil properties

‘Soil Paramaters/Properties _

“Type of Analysis Used

Soil pH

The Potentiometric method was used in determining
pH or free ion concentration in soils that makes use of
apH meter. This method is accordingly more accurate
than the use of indicator dyes or paper strips.

%Nitrogen (N)

The Modified Kjeldahl method was used in
determining the total nitrogen consisting of organic
and ammonium forms. It is a wet combustion and
reduction of all nitrogen to ammonia

Phosphorus (P)

The determination of available phosphorus in the soil
employs the procedure called Modified Truog method
(Ayres-Hagihara) that involves the removal of
adsorbed phosphate from the soil by an extracting
solution. Hue et.al described this as a procedure that
uses a solution of 0.01 M H2SOs + 0.3% (NH4)2 SOs
at a 1:100 soil:solution ratio, which is shaken 30
minutes to extract phosphorus for analysis.

Potassium (K)

The Flame photometer method is used to estimate the
K extracted from soil using an extracting solution,
neutral IN ammonium acetate.

‘%Organic matter (OM)

The Walkley-Black chromic acid wet oxidation
method was used to determine the soil organic carbon.
The compound K2Cr2O7 can be reduced by organic
matter by utilizing a specified volume of acidic
dichromate solution reacting with a determined
amount of soil in order to oxidize the OM.

Bulk Density

The Core Method was used in this particular experiment wherein a cylindrical metal
sampler was driven into the soil to the desired depth and carefully removing it with the soil
intact (Figure 9). The bulk density samples were then put inside a labelled plastic bag and

brought to ERDB Laboratory for weighing and oven drying at 105°C.

The calculation for bulk density is as follows:

Equation #1: Weight of oven-dry soil core (g)
0, (g/cm?) =
Volume of sample (cm?)

Figure 9. Soil sample collection for Bulk Density measurement using a cylindrical
metal sampler (Photos by GHRueda, November 2018).


Soil Moisture Content

In the laboratory where moisture content is normally determined by drying
techniques, some basic procedures involved the determination of the fresh weight of the
samples, heating these in an oven for 3-5 days at 105 °C, dried to a constant weight and re-
weighed when all of the water has been removed. The final weight of the sample was then
determined.

The wet basis moisture content of each of the replicate samples as a percentage of

its oven-dried weight was calculated using the following formula:

Equation #2: Weight of moist soil (g) - Weight of dry soil (g)
%MC= X 100
Weight of moist soil (g)

Assessment of

CO: and ex-situ CHs and N2O gas emissions

Four measurement plots under each vegetation cover type were established at the
site. These were the very same sampling points where the soil samples were collected right
after each gas collection. Using an Automated Soil Gas Flux System (LI-8100A or LiCor),
in-situ carbon dioxide (CO:) fluxes from the different land uses were determined. Samples
of other potent greenhouse gases such as CHs and N20 were also collected for laboratory

analysis.

Initially, four soil collars with 10 cm dimension were simultaneously inserted into
the peat soil and extended at ~ 3 cm above the soil surface to avoid leakage and were left

for more than 12 hours before sampling to attain equilibrium (Figure 10).

Figure 10. A. Soil collar inserted into the peat soil; B. The gas chamber traps gases
and C. The Soil Gas Flux System (Photos by GHRueda, November 2018).

For the initial set-up, the chamber cables, battery and a portable laptop were

connected to the LiCor, The chamber volume and soil area values were automatically

entered when the laptop was connected to the system and the communication (using LI-
8001A Windows Application software) was already established. The chamber was then
placed on top of the soil collar to close the set-up and trap the gas. The measurement started
when the infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) illuminated. The chamber automatically closed

when the in-situ measurement started and the progress was observed in the main window.

The gas samples were then extracted at time interval of 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes
using a 60-ml plastic syringe. The gas samples (20 samples each from different vegetation
cover, n=60) were injected and stored in labelled evacuated vials and were analyzed for
CH and N;0 at the IRRI Laboratory (Figure 11). The temperature inside the chamber and
the soil temperature were recorded simultaneously with each gas collection. Auxiliary
sensors (probes) for soil temperature and soil moisture were also pushed into the soil for
further measurements. The time of gas sample collection, as well as the weather condition
at the time of collection, were recorded. GPS coordinates were recorded for future data

collection.

At IRRI’s Kenzo Hemmi Laboratory (Figure 12), the gas samples were analyzed

using a Gas Chromatography Unit (GC SRI 8610C), a multiple gas analyzer designed for
the detection of carbon dioxide (CO:), methane (CHs) and nitrous oxide (N20) with flame
ionization detector (FID) and  methanizer (retrieved from _https://www.gmi-

Computation of fluxes

The concentration of gases, usually in ppm or umol, must be converted to a mass

basis using the ideal gas law (Sapkota et al., n.d.; Howard et al., 2014; Cooper et al., 2019b).

Equation #3: PV=NRT


Where:
P= atmospheric pressure = (1 atm)
V = volume of headspace = (1.1053 L)
N= number of moles (mol)
R = universal Gas Constant law (0.0820 L*atm/K*mol)
T= temperature in kelvin (K = 273 + temp in °C)
*with conversion factor: 1 mol of CO2= 44.01g
1 mol of CHs = 16.04 g
1 mol of N20 = 44.02g

The sample computation for CH, flux from sampling point | was indicated in Table

Determination of the rate of land use change and deforestation

The land cover and change of the study area were analyzed based from the different
datasets and images obtained. These datasets and images were 1953 topographic map from
the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority (NAMRIA) and 2009 & 2018
land cover images from Google Earth Pro version 7.3.2.5776. Moreover, the administrative
boundaries of the location of the study area were also used as reference to determine the
extent of the site. The aforementioned dataset was provided by Community Environment
and Natural Resources Office (CENRO) in Oriental Mindoro.

A combination of computer program and Geographic Information System (GIS)
software/ application was used to gather the necessary data needed in determining the land
cover change of the study area. The ArcGIS Version 10.4 was the GIS software/ application
used for creating and analyzing maps along with the information embedded on them,
collecting geographic data, sharing, discovering and managing geographic information in
a database.

The shapefile of the location that served as the boundary used in getting the land
cover change for years 1953, 2009 and 2018 was provided by the Protected Areas, Wildlife

and Coastal Zone Management Service (PAWCZMS) under the CENRO-Oriental

Mindoro. Using ArcGIS Version 10.4, the boundary from CENRO Oriental Mindoro and
the topographic map year 1953 of Bambanin which is already available from NAMRIA
was added to the project table to digitize the 1953 land cover map. In the absence of
available data for mapping, the Google Earth Pro as one of the possible sources of land
cover base maps, was used in this study. The boundary or shapefile acquired from
PAWCZMS has been converted into km! file and overlaid on Google Earth Pro to produce
the maps showing the land cover changes in Bambanin peatland covering the years 1953,
2009 and 2018.

For the future projection of land uses by 2050, the areas (in hectares) for each land
use in the years 1953, 2009 and 2018 were plotted in a graph using a scatter plot chart
where linear trendlines were generated. The corresponding linear equation of the trendline
was then used to project the area for each land use in the year 2050. Since the trendline
equations are linear, it is in the slope-intercept form y = mx + b, where ‘y' is the
corresponding area at a given year, 'm' is the projected slope or percent change in area, 'x’
is the year at which the area of land use is to be determined, and 'b’ is the y-intercept. Thus,
the projected area for each land use in 2050 can be estimated by substituting 2050 into 'x'

for each trendline equation


Determination of level of awareness of community members surrounding the
peatland on the ecological services it provides

In-depth interview with the local people through household interviews as well as
key informant interviews (KII) were conducted to understand their awareness and
perception of the ecological services being provided by the peatland.

The respondents’ level of awareness about peatland was measured through their
total score obtained from the five questions included in the survey tool. The queries were
dichotomous questions answerable by “Yes” or “No”. Since dichotomous questions are a
sub-type of a nominal measurement scale, only frequencies and percentages of the Yes and
No responses were presented and discussed. Please see Appendix 2 for the questionnaire

used.

Statisti

Analyses

Using IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 for Windows, descriptive statistics were performed
to analyze the data collected during wet and dry seasons of the study. Statistics including
means, standard deviations, standard errors including the minimum and maximum values
were described. This is true for water, soil and gas samples collected from the field. The
data were then summarized using tabulated and graphical descriptions.

‘The summarization of results and creation of tables from the household survey were
also done using the SPSS following descriptive statistics. Baseline information on socio-
demographic variables and frequencies using dichotomous queries were obtained and

summarized.

CHAPTER IV

RESULTS AND DICUSSIONS

Floristic Survey

Species Composition

The peatland in Brgy. Bambanin, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro was dominated by an
indicator species Lanipau (Terminalia copelandii Elmer). The height of this species ranged
from 5-13 meters and canopy ranged from 1-8 meters while the highest dbh is 45cm. Other

associated tree species observed were bangkal (Nauclea orientalis (L.) L.), putat

(Barringtonia cylindrical (L.) Blume ex DC.), Mangium (Acacia mangium Wild.), binunga
(Macaranga tanarius (L) Muell.-Arg), and Mangga (Mangifera indica Linn.). Understory
plants were also observed like tambo (Phragmites sp.), talahib (Saccharum spontaneum
L,) and cogon (/mperata cylindrica (L) Beauv.) of about 3-4 meters tall. Table 6 shows the

other flora species observed in the Bambanin peatland.

Avi-Faunal Assessment

Species composition, distribution and conservation status

A total of 21 species belonging to 19 familics of avifauna were observed in the arca
(Table 8). Dominant species was White-breasted Woodswallow (Artamus leucorynchus
Linn.) under family Artamidae. Co-dominant species observed were Glossy Swiflet
(Collocalia esculenta Linn.), Eurasian Tree Sparrow (Passer montanus Linn.) and Long-
tailed Shrike (Lanius schach Linn.), It is worth mentioning, though, that since peatland
studies are still in their infancy stage in the Philippines, this avifaunal assessment in

Bambanin peatland conducted by ERDB was the first baseline activity recorded.

Majority (9) of the species were insectivorous birds that feed mainly on insects,

spiders and other invertebrates.

Species include Glossy Swiftlet, Pacific Swallow,

Philippine Pied Fantail, Striated Grassbird, Pied Bushchat, Long-tailed Shrike, Philippine

Coucal, Brown Shrike and Golden-bellied Flyeater. This was followed by four bird species

(Black-naped Oriole, Asian Glossy Starling, Blackish Cuckoo-shrike and Everett's White-

eye) that were both insectivores and frugivores or those bird species whose diets consist

mainly of insects and fruits (tree fruits and berries), ‘The following feeding guilds were

represented each by only one bird species:

a) Camivore (White-collared Kingfisher) or bird species that basically feeds on

meat of mammals, birds, insects, amphibians, fish or reptiles. This is obtained

through hunting or scavenging;


b) Omnivore (Eurasian Tree Sparrow) or bird species which consumes a wide range
of diet that include insects, fish, lizards, crustaceans and other animals like
rodents as well as seeds, grains, grasses, nectar and fruits;

c) Insectivore/nectarivore (White-breasted Woodswallow) or bird species that feed

on both insects and nectars;

d) Frugivore (Oriental Magpie Robin);

€) Granivore/insectivore (Yellow-vented Bulbul) or bird that eats mainly seeds and
grains including insects

f) Nectarivore (Olive-backed Sunbird) or bird species that consumes high amounts
of nectar.

Two species of birds (Elegant Tit and White-breasted Munia) were found to be

granivorous.

to the water quality standards of Class AA waters based on DENR Administrative Order
No. 2016-08 or the Water Quality Guidelines and Effluent Standards of 2016. The
intended beneficial use of Class AA waters is for public supply use primarily for waters
having watersheds that are uninhabited or declared as protected areas. The mean
concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) in all three sites (grassland, cultivated and
forestland) during the wet season were below the standard level of 5 mg/L set by the DENR
(Table 12). Few residents who dug 2-3 medium to large-sized ponds inside the peatland
mentioned that they would be putting tilapia fingerlings and local shrimps. The DO values
that ranged from 2.70-4.57 mg/L could be harmful to aquatic life and might not support

large populations of different kinds of fishes.

Still referring to Table 12 above, another important parameter is the TDS that
measures the amount of particles that are dissolved in the water. In the case of Bambanin
where water from peatland is tapped for drinking, cooking and other household uses, the
mean TDS ranged between 460-604 mg/L which was an indication of very high water
contamination if the limit of 25 mg/L set by the DENR will be considered. However, the
US Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA), United States Public Health Service
(USPHS) and American Water Works Association (AWWA) set 500+ mg/L TDS as the
maximum contamination level for tap water (Fondriest Environmental, Inc., 2019). Meride
& Ayenew (2016), on the other hand, mentioned that the World Health Organization
(WHO) prescribed 500 mg/L and maximum limit of 1000 mg/L for drinking purpose. TDS
values obtained in the wet season, therefore, were still within the acceptable contamination
levels. In an interview with some of the residents surrounding the peatland, they said that
the water is clean and even tastes sweet, Some residents termed the water from the peatland
as “free flowing” and those residents living near or inside the peatland also built water

pumps to get the water they need. Accordingly, there were no recorded incidences of water-

related diseases or illnesses. Conductivity were likewise above the standards set by the
US-EPA of 150-500 uS/cm for inland freshwater while it should not be more than 400
uS/em as set by WHO (Meride & Ayenew, 2016). The rest of the parameters such as pH
wherein the acceptable range is 6.5-8.5, temperature with limits between 26-30°C and
salinity wherein the standard for river waters (0.5 ppt or less) was considered (Montagna
et.al, 2013) conformed to the DENR guidelines for water quality. According to Joosten
and Clarke (2002), peatland’s water quality is generally very good and that the deep brown

coloring or the tea-like color of the water can easily be removed.

In the dry season, mean water temperatures in all the study sites were higher as
compared to the wet season as shown in Table 13. Grassland demonstrated the highest
mean temperature of 34.53°C that went beyond the limit of 30°C for Class AA waters.
Burning of the grassland site prior to data collection, as they were readying the land for the
next cropping season, was seen as one of the factors that contributed to the unusual increase

in temperature. Apart from the dissolved oxygen (DO) that had extremely low mean values

that ranged from 0.63-1.27 mg/L, the rest of the physico-chemical parameters conformed

to the water quality standards of Class AA.

Figure 15 shows the kind of water Bambanin peatland has. It looks corroded,
yellowish or tea-like due to to the high humic acid content of the peat soil. Humic acids

are derived from the decomposition of plants and bacteria in the soil.

The level of pH in the soil could be a good measure of its fertility and suitability
for growing crops. Table 14 shows that soil acidity was high in all sites during wet and
dry seasons as reflected in the low pH values with average range of 4.3 to 6.0. In the soil
test interpretation guide provided by the Oregon State University Extension Service (2011),
the observed pH values were moderately acidic (between 5.2-6.0) to strongly acidic (<5.1).
Literature suggests that peatlands are characterized by low pH as well as low primary
productivity (Turner et al., 2016; Pemberton, 2005)

Referring to the Soil Test Handbook for Geogia (Kissel & Sonnon, 2008), the
amount of the required elements by the soil which include calcium (Ca) and magnesium
(Mg) decreases as pH decreases which may not meet crop requirement. On the contrary,
the amount of aluminum (Al) and manganese (Mn) increases as pH decreases which could

be toxic to plants. Accordingly, the low levels of pH also affect the soil microorganisms

leading to the slow formation of nitrates. This explains the relatively low amount of N
present in the soil samples. The soil analysis and fertilizer usage provided by the Bureau
of Soils and Water Management of the Department of Agriculture (BSWM-DA) indicated
that soil pH lower than 5.0 shows deficiencies in P, Ca, Mg and K while increased amount

of Al, Fe and Mn.

Mean pH values ranged from 4.66 to 5.18 and 4.96-5.38 in the wet and dry seasons,
respectively, indicating high soil acidity in all study sites (Table 15). Studies showed that
high soil acidity lowers CHs emission (Chareonsilp et.al, 2000) while Benham,
Vanguelova, & Pitman (2012) mentioned a study conducted by Parashar et al in 1991
where pH that ranged between 7.5 to 8.5 encouraged methanogenesis in four different soil
types in India. Increasing soil pH, on the other hand, can mitigate N2O emissions (Shaaban
et al., 2018; Hansen, Clough, & Elberling, 2014). High soil acidity in the sites under study
likewise affects the SOC as high pH reduces the formation of soil carbon, decreases
microbial activity that in turn reduces decomposition which might change the C:N ratio of

the soil (Benham et al., 2012).

all results are expressed as mean + standard error

Nitrogen (N)

One of the most important nutrients for plant and microbial growth is Nitrogen
(Amanullah et al., 2019;Dunn, et.al, 2006;Berger, Neubauer, & Glatzel, 2002). However,
high amounts of Nitrogen can change the composition of fungal and microbial
communities of soils (Cline, Huggins, Hobbie, & Kennedy, 2018; Wang et al., 2019; Zhou
et al., 2018). It was observed that mean values for nitrogen (N) were highest (0.82 & 0.97)
in grassland as compared to other land cover types within the peatland area for both seasons
(Table 15). It was assumed that most mineralized N from soil under optimal growth
conditions is used up by grassland soils (Deru et al., 2019). Past studies revealed that
concentration of soil organic carbon strongly effects N immobilization. In this experiment,
grassland demonstrated the highest organic matter content and consequently had the
highest %N among the sites. As compared to soils with less soil organic matter (SOM),
soils with higher organic matter content immobilize more N as more C provides substrate
to microbial metabolism (Barrett & Burke, 2000). In addition, the amount of nitrogen in

grassland soils increases logarithmically as moisture values increase. An increase in the


moisture leads to surface soils’ higher nitrogen and organic-matter content. Such
relationship is particularly distinct in grassland soils (Jenny, 1941). The availability of N
to plants, therefore, relies on the moisture content (Sonko, Tsado, Yaffa, Okhimamhe, &
Eichie, 2016). The succeeding part of the document will discuss the peat soil’s very high
moisture content especially in the wet season.

However, plants require 2.00- 5.00 percent nitrogen (Soil Test Handbook for
Georgia, 2008) and the values obtained for %N were still very low which could explain the
yield losses in rice farming based on the interview conducted by the author with the
community members. The sandy type of soil in the peatland can be attributed to the low
quantity of N in the samples as leaching of nitrate-N occurs in this soil condition (Soil Test
Handbook for Georgia, 2008). According to BSWM-DA, N contents from 0-2% are

considered low.
Phosphorus (P)

Phosphorus is one of the limiting nutrients for crops next to Nitrogen (USDA, 1994;
Ahmad et al., 2018). It plays a major role in the growth and reproductive processes of
plants and agricultural ecosystems (USDA, 1994; Cheng et al., 2018). Sufficient levels of
phosphorus stimulate root growth but soil with pH! values lower than $.5 limits the
availability of P to plants (USDA, 1994).

Itcan be seen in Table 15 that mean Phosphorus contents of soil samples in all sites
representing both seasons were very low which ranged from 1.29-2.37 ppm. Agvise
Laboratories (Northwood, North Dakota) interprets relative levels of phosphorus and

accordingly, the very low level ranges from 1-3 ppm while BSWM-DA considers low P

contents between 0-6 ppm. The soil test interpretation guide provided by the Oregon State
University Extension Service (2011), on the other hand, mentions that low levels of
phosphorus is <20 ppm. A & L Plains Agricultural Laboratories (Texas, USA) explains
that 20 to 30 ppm are adequate for soil P but a level of 40 to 60 ppm is desirable for most
crops to attain good yields. Such low levels of P in the samples could be attributed to low
soil pH. As peat soil becomes less acidic, higher P content was observed in all the sites
between seasons as reflected in Table 13. USDA (1994) indicated that pH less than 5.5
limits P availability to the plants as a result of fixation by other soil elements like
aluminum, iron, or calcium. As mentioned, the values obtained from both seasons were
way below the desirable P levels of 40-60 ppm. This explains the relatively low harvests

regardless of the cropping season as told by some farmers.

Potassium (K)

‘As compared to Nitrogen and Phosphorus, the amount of Potassium in soils was
relatively high. With insufficient quantity of Potassium in the soil, plant's growth processes
are impaired. Potassium stands in between N and P in terms of its effects in the growth of
crops. It slows down the effects of too much Nitrogen in the soil while preventing the fast
maturity of plants owing to high levels of Phosphorus (Cooper, Schreiner, & Brown, 1938).

Table 15, however, shows the very low amounts of Potassium from the samples
that ranged from 0.05-0.37% in both seasons of collection. According to Epstein (1965),
1% is the typical minimum concentration of Potassium that is required for plant growth.
The very low levels of K might be one of the reasons why farmers complained of stunted

growth of crops coupled with very low harvests in each cropping season. Plants might

have also taken up the less soluble forms of Potassium resulting to a slow growth of crops
and it took longer time for these crops to absorb the available Potassium (Cooper et al.,
1938).

In the dry season measurement, Potassium displayed huge decreases as soil
temperature must have a significant effect on the soil K since all the sites had high soil
temperatures that ranged from 30.77°- 33.53°C. A study by Weber et.al (1964) mentioned
that yields were higher with the application of K at low rather than high soil temperatures.
Literature also indicates that K availability and uptake differ significantly considering
various factors like soil texture, soil moisture, plant types and land management (IPNI,
1998). The decrease in the soil moisture content in the dry season also considerably

affected the ability of the soil to absorb potassium.
Organic Matter (OM)

‘As mentioned in the review of literature, organic matter is one of the most important
properties of peat soils. However, the destruction of organic matter due to cropping for
example, which is widespread in the study site, will change the soil structure. When this
happens, sandy particles that are very evident in the soil samples collected from Bambanin
peatland, will be devoid of organic matter. As a result, water will run too fast and the peat
soil’s water holding capacity will be decreased. Plant growth will not be encouraged with
this condition where water and minerals are not retained. Sandy soils are favorable for
plant growth as water penetrates to the lower layers and air movement is not impeded.

It is also worth mentioning that a study conducted in different areas covering the

peat swamp forest in Ghana got the same results on the peat soil’s textural grade where

sandy particles dominated the soil texture distribution (Jengre, n.d.). Table 15 showed the
mean values for OM that ranged between 11.24-16.43% and 15.10-19.37% in the wet and
dry season, respectively. Most soil fractions across sites have OM level of more than 15%
although by average, only the grassland soils met this criterion in the wet season while all
sites had more than 15% OM in the dry season (Appendix 5).

Results of this experiment showed that average OM was highest in the grassland
area (17.91%) followed by the forestland (15.05%) and cultivated land (13.62%)
representing both seasons of the study. These results were similar to a study on relative
efficiency of roots and tops of plants in Nebraska (Kramer, 1956) where they revealed that
grass soils are much richer in humus (organic component of soil) than the forest soil and
that grasses produce more OM underground than aboveground. Grassland produces deep
roots that decay in the deeper portions of the soil (Sustainable Agriculture and Soil
Conservation, 2009). A cultivated land is expected to have a low OM level as plowing
mixes oxygen into the soil raising its average temperature resulting in an increased rate of
organic matter decay. As soils are being eroded due to tilling, it washes away fertile topsoil
and humus leading to the occurrence of OM loss (Sustainable Agriculture and Soil
Conservation, 2009; McLauchlan, 2006). Decline in OM in forestland in the wet season
was due to anthropogenic factor such as the establishment of drainage canals up to about |
meter deep. The soil samples were collected approximately 1.5 meters away from the
drainage canals. The water table was also found to be lowest in the forestland (97.5 cm
from the soil surface) during the wet season and literature suggests that greater

decomposition of soil organic matter are at sites with a lower water table (L. Liu et al.,

2018a). The wetter the soil is, the lower the possibility that peat oxidation is occurring, the

greater the amount of accumulated organic matter (Sustainable Agriculture and Soil
Conservation, 2009).

Organic matter (OM) is a very dynamic soil property and could be affected by
various environmental factors such as soil moisture content and water table levels. In the
wet season, OM was significantly influenced by the water table levels across sites, that is,
OM content decreased with lowered water table height. High water table is essential in
maintaining high organic matter and soil organic carbon in a peatland ecosystem. In the
dry season, however, accumulation of organic matter was observed despite the much lower

water table levels (from the soil surface) in all the sites (Figure 16).

Figure 16. Water table drawdown and organic matter content across sites and
between seasons


At the cultivated site, the accumulation of organic matter must be due to the fact
that the land remained untouched/untilled for 4 months since the last data collection from
the wet season in November 2018. It is evident that keeping the peat soil in its natural
condition will guarantee accumulation of organic matter and soil carbon. This particular
site also had the lowest water table level that inhibits microbial activities thus
decomposition was also reduced resulting in the increased organic matter content.
Microbes and other soil macro-invertebrates are accordingly more active in a moist
(aerobic) condition which encourages faster decomposition of some features of the organic
matter like the fine roots (Stolt & Lindbo, 2010). Preece, Verbruggen. Liu, Weedon, &
Pefiuelas (2019) proved that drought has negative effects on the composition and diversity
of soil microbial communities.

Increased OM content was likewise observed at the forested site. This unusual
increase in OM in a very short time does not normally happen in a forested area as
accumulation of OM in this ecosystem is normally very slow. There are few tree roots that
decay even in a year that could add to their organic matter. The presence of more trees that
could produce more litters and OM in the dry season will not suffice to explain such
increase. One factor that could explain this sudden increase in the OM was that the soils

in the permanent sampling points must have been buried/replaced by adjacent soils.

Through time, the walls of the holed forest floor must have collapsed depositing top soils
beneath. As topsoil layer in a forested area are rich in organic matter, these soils must have
mixed with the soils that have been dug in the previous data collection.

Grassland site still had the highest OM content just like in the wet season collection.

‘As mentioned in the previous discussion, more organic matter is substantially stored in the

soil and roots of grasses which could be attributed to the relatively high OM content despite
the burning of the top layer of the grassland soil in the dry season. The decay of roots,
particularly in the deeper portion (100-150 cm-depth), could explain the variability in the

belowground OM of the grassland site.

Soil Organic Carbon (SOC)

Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is an estimate of Soil Organic Matter (SOM) because
the former is an indicator of soil quality due to the important role the latter performs in the
overall chemical, physical and biological processes of the soil (Cotching, 2018;
McLauchlan, 2006). It is necessary to convert SOM content to SOC contents through what
we call conversion factors to be able to evaluate the stocks and changes in SOC
(KlingenfuB, RoBkopf, Walter, Heller, & Zeitz, 2014). SOC-SOM conversion factors for
surface soils range from 1.72 to 2.0 (Nelson and Sommers, 1982; Klingenfub et al., 2014;
B. W. Murphy, 2014). Organic matter can be calculated by multiplying organic C by the
conventional factor 1.74 (Jenny, 1941) and factor values between 1.4-2.5 (Pribyl, 2010) to
consider likely variation in the organic matter composition. To do a generic conversion of
soil organic carbon from organic matter (OM), OM is simply divided by the conversion
factor of 1.72 (Pribyl, 2010; Karlsson, 2012).

As shown earlier, Table 15 indicated the mean values for the SOC that ranged
between 6.54-9.56% and 8.78-1 1.26% in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. Grassland
exhibited the highest SOC contents for both seasons and across sites.

The photo below (Figure 17) reflects the color of the peat soil which is naturally

black or dark brown in color owing to the very high carbon content.

Figure 18, on the other hand, shows the sampling points within the Bambanin
peatland where soil samples were collected. These were the same sampling points where

the analysis of GHG fluxes was conducted.

Water Table drawdown

Water table depth or the distance of the ground water from the soil surface and its
effects to the peatland vulnerability and ecosystem functions were already well studied.

Increase in water table depth in peatland areas can be attributed mainly to drainage

(Heikurainen, Paivinen, & Sarasto, 2017) that causes peat subsidence (Nusantara,
Hazriani, & Suryadi, 2018), triggers changes in vegetation composition (Benavides, 2014).
stimulates fires and carbon loss (Kettridge et al., 2015), influences greenhouse gas

emissions such as methane and carbon dioxide (Moore & Knowles, 2010) and organic

matter decomposition (Laiho, 2006; Bader, Miller, Schulin, & Leifeld, 2018).


It was already discussed earlier how water table height, particularly in the wet
season of the study, affected the decomposition of organic matter content of the soil.
Keeping the peatland in its natural condition will mean creating favorable hydrologic
conditions to guarantee provisions of ecological services. Ideally, the water table (WT)
must be closer to the soil surface to inhibit decay of organic matter and consequent release
of greenhouse gases. However, results of the study revealed that WT levels across sites
were low in the wet scason and were reduced further in the dry season (Figure 19).
Drainage in the forested and cultivated areas and burning in the grassland site were seen to

be the major causes of such decrease in the WT.

Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) Stock

SOC stock expressed in tonnes of carbon per hectare can be computed by
multiplying the soil organic carbon (%) by the mass of soil in a given volume, bulk density
and soil layer depth (Dinca, Dinca, Vasile, Sparchez, & Holonec, 2015; Lee, Hopmans,

Rolston, Baer, & Six, 2009; Teixeira, Luizio, Marques, Vitel, & Marques, 2016; Schrumpf,

Schulze, Kaiser, & Schumacher, 2011; Holden & Connolly, 2011; Akumu & McLaughlin,
2014; Bourgeau-Chavez et al., 2018; Leifeld, Bassin, & Fuhrer, 2005; Castillo, Apan,
Maraseni, & Salmo, 2017).
Sample computation:
1. Considered top soil up to 30 em in depth (~ 0.30 m)
2. Bulk density (1 g/m? = 1 tonne/m®) — further discussion on BD in the
succeeding pages

3. Area (1 hectare = 10,000 m?)

Equation #5: SOC Stock = (SOC) x (Bulk density x Depth x Area)

Peat soils can store carbon between 30-700 ha (Agus, Hairiah, & Mulyani, 2011;
Wahyunto et.al, 2010). Table 16 shows that the computed carbon stocks fell within the
range of carbon that can be stored by a tropical peatland. These values, however, were
observed to be relatively lower compared to other SEA countries like Indonesia with an
estimated 50 + 10 Gt of carbon (Jaenicke et al., 2008) and Malaysia with 114 kg/m2 (or

equivalent to 1140 tC/ha) (Padmanabhan et al., 2013).

Table 16. Soil Organic Carbon Stocks across sites and between seasons

LAND USE/ SITE SOC STOCKS (tC/’ha)

Forestland 63.41 122.32
Cultivated land 39.89 53.65
Grassland 53.56 221.63

AVERAGE 52.29 13.


Generally in a peatland ecosystem, large amount of C is stored in the soil while less
amount is found in its vegetation (Akumu & McLaughlin, 2013; Agus et al., 2011; Gorham,
1991; Poirier et al., 2018). Typically, forestlands and grasslands are net C sinks while
cultivated lands could be minor sources (Schrumpf et al., 2011; Oertel, Matschullat, Zurba,
Zimmermann, & Erasmi, 2016). This generalized statement concurred with the results of
this experiment. Table 16 reflects the computed soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks for both
seasons which showed that SOC stocks were higher in both forestland and grassland while
relatively low C stocks were observed in the cultivated land. It should be noted that these
calculations took into consideration the layer depth of 0-30 cm or the top soil as this layer
contains the most organic matter and carbon (Angst et al., 2018; Fang, Chen, Wan, Yang,
& Shi, 2015; Grote & Al-kaisi, 2007; Gregory et al., 2016; Leifeld et al., 2005; Vaisanen,
2014).
Table 17 below indicates the comparison on the Bambanin peatland’s soil carbon

stocks with other tropical peatlands.

‘As mentioned, the estimates of C stocks in Bambanin were limited to the first 30
cm layer of the soil. Comparing the computed soil C stocks of Bambanin (ave 132.53 tC/ha
in dry season) with the estimates done by Alibo in Caimpugan peat dome (4659 tC/ha)
during dry season of 2011 where a soil depth of 560 cm was taken (Table 17), Bambanin
peatland’s C stock was a little over half of said estimate (2518.07 tC/ha). Several factors
may have contributed to the comparatively low soil C stocks in Bambanin apart from depth
(19x deeper in Caimpugan) as C stocks increase with depth. Second factor is the
vegetation. Caimpugan is a well-preserved peatland area composed of tall pole,
intermediate and pygmy forests while Bambanin’s vegetation is composed mainly of very
small patches of secondary forests. Trees that produce many litters accelerate production
of organic matter and carbon. The third most significant factor is the lack of
agricultural/farming activities inside the Caimpugan peatland that added to the formation
of more organic matter. In addition, Alibo mentioned that Caimpugan was still excessively
waterlogged even in the dry season in contrast to Bambanin where soil moisture content
decreased significantly in the dry season. High water content inhibits the decomposition of
organic matter.

On the other hand, the estimates of belowground C stocks of Eastern Indonesian
peatlands that ranged between 1196.30 - 1774.70 tC/ha (Taberima et al., 2018) took
samples up to 300 cm depth which was 10x deeper than what was taken from Bambanin
(30 cm). The estimated C stock in Bambanin was 1325.30 tC/ha (taking into account the
ave C stock of 132.53 tC/ha) which was very close or could even be higher than that of

Indonesian peatlands. Just like Bambanin, Indonesian peatlands are also utilized for

agriculture, mainly for oil palm plantations, that destroys the organic matter, thus, reducing

the soil C stocks.

Bulk Density

The soil bulk density (Dt) is the weight of the dry soil divided by the total soil
volume and is expressed in g/cm?. It has direct effect on some soil properties including
porosity, available water content (AWC) and organic matter (Abdelbaki, 2018; Chaudhari,
Ahire, Ahire, Chkravarty, & Maity, 2013). Accurate determination of soil bulk density
leads to better understanding of the soil’s physical, chemical, and biological properties (Al-
Shammary et al., 2018; Patton, Lohse, Seyfried, Will, & Benner, 2019) and a very useful
tool in measuring the degree of soil compaction, interpretation of nutrient budget and
carbon inventories (Hossain, Chen, & Zhang, 2015; Alemu Bekele, 1998; Reyes & Taguas,

2017).

Bulk density is generally dependent on the density of soil mineral such as sand, silt
and clay. Sandy soils tend to have a relatively high bulk density because their total pore
space is less than silt or clay soils (Alemu Bekele, 1998). Normally, sandy particles would
have a BD of 1.2-1.8 g/em? (Chaudhari et al., 2013; Rivenshield & Bassuk, 2007);
approximately 1.6 g/cm* (Agrilnfo.in, 2015) However, results of this study showed that

BD is fairly low despite the presence of sandy soils (Table 18).


Table 18. Computed bulk density in each land use for both seasons

BULK DENSITY (g/em’)
WET DRY
Forestland 0.23 0.35
Cultivated land 0.45 0.38
Grassland 0.22 0.57

‘As mentioned in the earlier discussions, the soil samples collected from the three
land uses for both seasons were mainly composed of sandy particles, with an average of
73% in forestland, 68% in cultivated land and 84% in grassland. The low values of BD
obtained in the wet season must have controlled by the relatively high organic matter (OM)
content. Organic matter improves soil properties which include bulk density as OM holds
soil particles together therefore changing the soil’s shape and size (Bauer, 1974). Thus, as
OM increases, BD decreases (Chaudhari et al., 2013; Morisada, Ono, & Kanomata, 2004;
Erdal Sakin, 2012). Peat’s low bulk density ranges from 0.02 - 0.254 g/cm? (Rezanezhad
et al., 2016) or from 0.013-0.30 g/cm? (Rudiyanto et al., 2016). Table 18 showed that both
forestland and grassland had low BD of 0.23 g/m? and 0.22 g/cm’, respectively, in the wet
season. However, the BD obtained from the cultivated land (0.45 g/cm?) was higher than
that of the two land uses which was an indication of soil compaction. Farm practices such
as tilling, plowing and equipment travel contribute to the compaction of the soil leading to

a higher bulk density.

Degree of decomposition also affects soil bulk density. However, comparing peat

soil with mineral soil, a relatively low bulk density is still expected even in the highly

decomposed peat because of its high OM content (Rezanezhad et al., 2016; Driessen,

1977).

In the dry season, however, increased BD in the forested and grassland areas and
decreased BD in the cultivated site were observed (Table 18). Cultivated site showed
decreased bulk density from 0.45 to 0.38 g/em? as the said site has not been planted again
with rice after the first cropping in the wet season due to insufficient supply of water and
the soil’s very dry condition during summer as told by one of the residents of Bambanin
Agricultural activities that made the soil compacted temporarily stopped thus decreasing
the soil’s BD. Forestland’s BD, in contrast, increased from 0.23 to 0.35 g/em?. Root
growth and expansion is one of the natural processes that increases soil bulk density in a
forested area (Cubera, Moreno, & Solla, 2009). There were also people passing by the
forested area’s sampling site in going to their respective farm areas. Grassland’s BD
increased from wet season’s 0.22 to dry season's 0.57 g/cm’ due to burning of the site for
the succeeding cropping season. A study in North Shoa, Oromis Region in Ethiopia
conducted by Kiya (2016) revealed that traditional burning of soil increased bulk density
from 1.42 to 1.55 g/cm? from the top of the burned heaps or fields. Massman (2006)
mentioned that bulk density generally increases due to fire as a result of their experiment
on the effects of burns in the BD and thermal conductivity of South Colorado soils. A
study by R. J. Williams, Hallgren, & Wilson (2012) revealed an increase in upland oaks
forest's soil bulk density as a result of low intensity burning. Apart from burning, our
guide during the time of collection mentioned that the previously undisturbed grassland

area would be planted with corn in the dry season. Farmers practically went to the

grassland site everyday to prepare the land for the next cropping season that made the soil
compacted. In addition, more farmers of the adjacent corn plantation used the same site in
going to their farm which must have contributed to the sudden increase in grassland soil's
BD in the dry season. A study on a drained agricultural peatland in Sacramento, California
also showed a comparatively high bulk density of 0.57 g/cm? and 0.65 g/cm? for partially

untilled and tilled rice paddy (Hatala et al., 2012).

Soil moisture content

Soil water content is a measure of the amount of water (volume or mass) contained
ina unit volume or mass of soil (Campbell & Campbell, 2005). It is important to know the
moisture content of a soil as changes in the moisture content can significantly alter the
properties of soils, thus, affecting the vital functions that soils perform such as in
decomposition (G. Wang et al., 2019; Morugén-Coronado, Garcia-Orenes, McMillan, &
Pereg, 2019; Ahmed, Mengistie, Godbold, & Sandén, 2019), nutrient cycling (Ouyang, Xu,
Hao, & Gao, 2017), carbon sequestration (Gao, Li, Zhao, Ma, & Wu, 2018; Jia et al., 2016;
Srinivasarao et al., 2014) and food production (Wijewardana, Reddy, & Bellaloui, 2019;

C. Zhang, Liu, Shang, & Cai, 2018; Shittu, Oyedele, & Babatunde, 2017).

The hydrological characteristic of peatlands is its very high water content that
distinguishes it from other ecosystems (Joosten, Hans: Clarke, 2002) and could store water
more than 20 times of their solid mass (Bispo et al., 2016; Prentice, 2011). Literature
suggests that it could be attributed to the high OM content of the peat soils as it increases

the soil's water holding capacity (Bauer, 1974; Dickopp, Lengerer, & Kazda, 2018; Obour

et al., 2018). Soil moisture patterns considerably affect the carbon dioxide dynamics of
peat soils and their role to greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere (J. Gong et al.,
2013; Millard & Richardson, 2018).

Referring to the results in Table 19, all sites had high moisture contents with

grassland exhibiting the highest (85.67%) during the wet season. A previous study

explained that the water uptake capacity of grasses increases the temporal heterogeneity of

soil moisture since the fine root length per unit volume of soil in grassland is estimated to
be 20 times larger than that of the forestland (James, Partel, Wilson, & Peltzer, 2003). On
the other hand, forestland is expected to have more moisture content (76.29%) than

cropland (75.39%) as trees and their roots absorb and retain more water than the open

cropland (especially after the harvest season) which is devoid of any vegetation.

Soil moisture content is affected by a number of soil properties particularly bulk

density and organic matter content (Mei et al., 2019). For the dry season, grassland had

the highest bulk density of 0.57 g/cm3 that corresponds to a low soil moisture content due
to compaction. lek, Kucza, & Szostek (2017) discussed that the capacity of forest soils to
store water is related to its soil’s bulk density.

Figure 21 reflects the massive decrease in peat soil's moisture contents between

seasons and across sites.

Figure 21. Observed changes in soil moisture content of different land uses/sites for
wet and dry seasons

As mentioned carlier, grassland area where field sampling was conducted was
bumt for agricultural purposes which must be the reason for low moisture content. A huge
86% decrease, that is, from 85.67% to as low as 11.91%, in the moisture content was
observed from that of the wet season collection, Temperature, of course, was a major factor

affecting the soil’s moisture content.


Forests lose more water due to plant growth and transpiration (Mei et al., 2019)
coupled with the fact that, as discussed previously, the sampling points were established
near the drainage canals that resulted to a large decrease of 68% (from 76.29% to 24.20%)
in the soil moisture content during the dry season. The presence of water-loving and fast
growing trees such as Acacia mangium and Mahogany likewise contributed to the low soil
moisture content at the forested area. Cultivated area had the lowest decrease in the
moisture content of 66% from wet season’s 75.39% to dry season’s 25.89%. Aside from
drainage, high evaporation rate normally occurs in an open unshaded area as it is more

exposed to the air.

Assessment of in-situ CO2 and ex-situ CHs and N20 emissions

Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are the main causes of rising temperature of the Earth's
atmosphere otherwise known as global warming. Such phenomenon is induced by
anthropogenic activities. The three generally recognized GHGs are carbon dioxide (CO),
methane (CHs) and nitrous oxide (N20) characterized by their long atmospheric lives and
their relatively high thermal absorption capacities (Barbera, Vymazal, & Maucieri, 2019;
Courtois et al., 2018).

The report of Joosten (2010) on peatland status and drainage related emissions in
all countries of the world for years 1990 and 2008 reflected the Philippines’ insignificant
contribution to global CO2 emissions in the context of peatland emissions (Table 20). Be
that as it may, updated science-based information on GHG emissions of Philippine

peatlands is necessary not only for the GHG inventories in the national, regional and global

levels but also for the development of necessary mitigation and adaptation measures to

increase the community's resilience to climate change.

In most peatland ecosystems, drainage became a very common activity so that peat
soils can be utilized for agriculture but this action causes greenhouse gas emission
particularly COz emission (Courtois et al., 2018, M. Wang et al., 2017, Couwenberg, 2009;
Lal, 2016; Musarika et al., 2017). Such is also the case in Bambanin peatland where a
seemingly endless network of drainage canals measuring between 0.5 to 1.5 meters deep
could be seen practically everywhere. The deepest canals were observed to be established

near the forested area.

Figure 22 shows the different land uses and the area they occupy in the Bambanin
peatland. In computing for the GHG fluxes, however, only 3 land uses were considered

such as forestland, grassland and cultivated land.

Figure 22. Land use map of Bambanin Peatland, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro


Carbon Dioxide (CO2)

Environmental factors such as soil temperature, soil moisture, and available carbon
triggers soil CO2 fluxes (Barbera et al., 2019). Due to its high emission amount of more
than 60% and being a strong absorber of infrared radiation, COz became the most
important greenhouse gas and has long been used as a reference gas despite its very low
global warming potential (GWP) of 1, considered to be the lowest among all of the GHGs
earlier mentioned (Dellasala, Goldstein, Cloy, & Smith, 2018).

Inthe in-situ flux measurement conducted, highest average CO2 emission of 656.70
umol m? min"! (~151.91 Mg hay'') was observed at the forestland in the wet season (Table

21).

As mentioned in the earlier discussions, sampling points in the forested area were

near drainage canals which might have caused the high CO2 flux. Drainage increases
emissions of CO2 but lowers emissions of CHs (Strack, 2008). It can be recalled that this,
land use had the lowest organic matter (OM) content (11.25%) and highest water table
drawdown (97.5 cm below the soil surface) in the wet season. Unstable organic matter
may disrupt global C cycle contributing to climate change (Lopes-Mazzetto, Schellekens,
Vidal-Torrado, & Burman, 2018). Water table drawdown, on the other hand, hastens peat
oxidation and decomposition leading to increased carbon emissions (Dohong et al., 2017;
Liu et al., 2018b; Liu et al., 2018a; Dinsmore, Skiba, Billett, & Rees, 2009). When water
table is low, mineralization of the oxic portion of peat soils occurs releasing CO> to the
atmosphere (Leng et al., 2018). The study of Moore & Knowles (2010) discovered a linear
relationship on the increased CO2 emission and lowered water table. In addition to this, the
decomposition of tropical peat soil both in their drained and natural environments mainly
releases CO2 (Jauhiainen, Page, & Vasander, 2016, IPCC. 2014) Average CO> fluxes of
cultivated and grassland sites were and 374.85 umol m? min’! (~86.71 Mg ha‘y"') and
215.70 umol m? min! (~49.89 Mg hay"), respectively. Tillage, as already mentioned
previously, speeds up organic matter decomposition leading to increased CO2 emission
(Buragiene et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2019; Chatskikh & Olesen, 2007; Silva et al., 2019).
The grassland where the sampling was conducted, on the other hand, was an undisturbed
part of the peatland, hence, emission was expected to be very low. The study on the
variation of carbon dioxide fluxes in a grassland ecosystem in Loess Plateau in China (F.
Yang et al., 2019) discovered that grassland was a weak source of carbon with a mean flux

of only 17.1 + 12.1. gC m*y!. Similar research was conducted by S. Liu et al. (2018) in

the grasslands of Norther China between the 1980s and 2000s and authors learned that
there is no notable changes in the topsoil layer of this ecosystem and remained to be a
neutral soil organic carbon sink in the years mentioned.

Figure 23 shows the in-situ CO> fluxes that were measured by the automated soil
flux system (LiCOr- 8100A) from each sampling point established at the cultivated site in
the wet season. Relatively the same increasing trend was observed for both grassland and

forested sites.

The study of Ratcliffe, Campbell, Clarkson, Wall, & Schipper (2019) hypothesized
that if cropland's water table continues to drop and if vegetation cover will not change

significantly, then, this land use might be a source of CO>. This hypothesis was proven by

the study’s results for the dry season as cultivated area demonstrated the lowest water table
(118.50 cm) thus emitted the highest CO2 of 1005.00 umol m min’! (~232.47 Mg ha"'y"),
aremarkable 63% increase from the wet season's CO2 emission. Please refer to Figure 24,
Just like in the wet season, forestland also continued to emit a high amount of CO2 (739.35
umol m? min" or ~171.02 Mg ha''y") in the dry season with a comparatively small increase
of 11%, There was also an observed 52% increase in the CO emission from the grassland
site (444.75 umol m? min"! or ~102.88 Mg ha'y") from the wet season owing to the
burning of the area to be utilized for agriculture. The soil moisture content significantly

decreased in the grassland area that likewise contributed to the increase in the CO2

emission.

Figure 24, Seasonal variations on the gross CO: fluxes across sites


Table 22 shows the comparison of gross CO> fluxes of tropical peatlands found in
Bambanin, West Kalimantan, Indonesia and Sarawak, Malaysia. It can be seen that the
COz flux for degraded forest in Bambanin doubled that of West Kalimantan’s. In the article
on soil COz respiration on degraded peatland forest (Astiani et.al, 2015) where the author
retrieved all the figures, there was no mention on the depth of the drainage canals or the
distance of the sampling sites from these canals and the species planted. For the cropland’s

emi

ions, Bambanin site was planted with rice while West Kalimantan was planted with
Pineapple. Though the fluxes did not differ much from each other, it indicated, however,
that CO2 respiration differs significantly among species of crops. Bumt areas in the
Bambanin peatland referred to the grassland site that was burt before the actual data
collection and it can be observed that the emission was also comparable to that of West
Kalimantan’s. West Kalimantan showed a higher emission but details of the burt areas

or the duration of the fire were not mentioned.

On the other hand, a study in Sarawak Malaysia on the CO2 and CHs emissions of
tropical peat soil installed in oil palm plantation revealed a mean gross CO> flux ranged
between 78-625 mg C mh"! (~25.03-200 Mg COz ha'!y) which was very near the average
gross COz flux in Bambanin (161 Mg CO2 ha''y"' ) at the forested area. Another gross
estimate of 126 Mg CO? ha''y"' for the CO2 emissions of peatlands of Indonesia and
Malaysia was also provided but such amount was an average of a 3-yr study while
Bambanin’s emission was a result of a one-time collection for both seasons.
The total gross CO2 emissions of the whole peatland area was 2,544.69 Mg ha''y" and
3,961.53 Mg ha"'y"' in the wet and dry seasons, respectively, the highest emissions among
the three greenhouse gases under study that made this peatland evidently a CO2 source.

Methane (CHs)

The emission of CHs in peatland ecosystem is mainly driven by the activities of
methanogenic archaea under anoxic conditions through the process of diffusion, ebullition
and transport facilitated by plants (Couwenberg & Fritz, 2012; M. Wang et al., 2017; Neue,
Gaunt, Wang, Becker-Heidmann, & Quijano, 1997). High methane emission is
particularly evident in a rice production system that demands a relatively huge volume of
water (Neue et al., 1997). Previous research on the effect of water table level on the
greenhouse gas emissions from a peatland discovered that high emissions of CHs is closely
associated with high water table (Dinsmore et al., 2009). Similarly, low methane emission
with low water table was observed by Moore & Knowles (2010) when they studied the
effect of water table levels on peatland methane emissions.

Drained peatland barely releases CHs as water table is one of the main controls of
methane production in natural or pristine peatlands (M. Wang et al., 2017; Joosten, Hans;
Clarke, 2002). The contribution of CHs is comparatively smaller than CO2 emissions in
drained peatlands (Couwenberg, 2009). This explains the relatively low amount of CHa
released in the atmosphere from the three study sites in Bambanin peatland during the time
of collection.

Figure 26 shows that grassland exhibited the highest CHs emissions among the
study sites for both wet and dry seasons which can be attributed to the relatively high water
table levels compared to the other land uses. Gross CHs emission combining the three land
uses for both seasons was 3.55 Mg ha"'yr! which was beyond comparison with the gross

CO2 emission of 3252.11 Mg ha''y"'as reference.

Figure 26. Comparison of CH4 fluxes between seasons with reference to the water
table depth

The relationship of water table with the CHs emissions was already established, i.c.,
the lower the water table is, the lower is the emission of CHs. Results of this study
concurred with this statement as cultivated and forested areas with respective water table
levels that reached 126.50 cm and 118.50 cm from the soil surface in the dry season
displayed negative CHs emissions of -0.003 Mg ha"'y" and -0.002 Mg hay"! (Figure 26).
The grassland site likewise demonstrated an enormous decrease in CH, emission from wet
season's 0.58 Mg ha''y''to dry season’s 0.13 Mg ha''y" owing to the lowered water table
from 26.00 cm to 73.25 cm, Such was an indication that the peatland was a sink rather

than a source of CHs during the dry season. Burning also decreases CHs emission but

increases CO2 emission as cited by Minamikawa, Sakai, & Yagi (2006) in their study on
methane emissions on paddy fields. It was also stated in the study of Chidthaisong et al.
(2018) that drainage or lowering the water table reduces CHs emission because of the
introduction of oxygen into the soil that inhibits methanogenesis. Das & Adhya (2012),
on the other hand, indicated that elevated CO2 emission coupled with high temperature, as
evident in this experimental result, reduces CHs emission since it inhibits population of
CHs-oxidizing bacteria. The study done by Chareonsilp et.al (2000) acquired low CHs
emission values as the study was conducted from a highly acidic (pH-3.93) rice fields in
Thailand. Such result could explain the negative and very low emissions of CHu across the
study sites.

Table 24 reflects the gross CH, emissions among tropical peatlands that are found
in the Philippines, Malaysia and China. It can be seen that CHs emissions in Bambanin are
comparable to the other peatlands, however, due to different locations, mode of data
collection, age and size of peatlands and other environmental factors, slight differences

exist in the values obtained.

Nitrous Oxide (N20)

The N20 emissions are generally influenced by some environmental variables that
include soil moisture, soil pH, temperature, water table level, vegetation, agricultural
practices and availability of organic carbon (Courtois et al., 2018). Agriculture actually
represents 66% of the total NzO emissions sources (Jalota et al., 2018). The emissions are
enhanced by the application of fertilizers for improved yields. In Bambanin peatland, only
18.82% of the farmers interviewed apply fertilizers with frequency of 1-4 times per
cropping season.

N20 emissions from peatlands also decrease with acidic soil environment and low
nitrogen content (Josten, Hans; Clarke, 2002). Negligible emissions of N:O are generally
observed in nutrient-poor soils like peatlands (Couwenberg, 2009). In fact, a study
conducted over a year by Inubushi, Furukawa, Hadi, Purnomo, & Tsuruta (2003) on the
seasonal variations in the emissions of CO2, CHa and N20 in South Kalimantan, Indonesia
acquired negative values for N2O emissions across sites under study. The results of
Bambanin experiment followed almost the same trend which reflected the very low, almost
negligible average gross emissions of NO across land uses and between seasons
(Forestland, 0.012 Mg ha’'y"!; Cultivated land, 0.004 Mg ha‘'y"'; Grassland, 0.024 Mg ha’

'y') as shown in Figure 27.

Figure 27. Seasonal variations on N20 fluxes across sites

Forestland and grassland had the highest recorded N2O emissions in the wet (0.017
‘Mg ha‘'y’') and dry (0.045 Mg ha''y"') seasons, respectively. It also reflected the decreases
in N20 emissions at the cultivated and forested sites in the dry season. Since rice farming
has not commenced yet at the time of collection, the non-application of fertilizer must have
explained the very low N20 emission particularly in the cultivated site. Moreover, the
relatively high soil temperature (33.53°C) in the grassland site must have contributed to the
release of N:O to the atmosphere in the dry season. A study on the emission factor of
nitrous oxide during warm and cold cropping season in South Korea also revealed a strong
relationship between N2O emission and soil temperature (Alam et al., 2019). An increase
of 85.06% was observed from cold (0.13%) to warm (0.87%) cropping season. Another

study conducted by Quang et al. (2019) revealed that N2O emission is not affected by

water management which is contradictory to the results of the study by Manalil & Flower
(2014) where they observed a significant positive correlation between N2O emission and
soil moisture content as well as soil N content. The low soil N2O fluxes revealed the sites’
very low inorganic N levels in the soil

Of the three greenhouse gases, N2O displayed the smallest production in the whole
peatland area with a total of 0.43 Mg ha''y". Its mean fluxes in the wet season ranged from
0.01 to 0.08 umol m? min" as previously shown in Table 23.

Table 25 shows the comparison on the N20 fluxes among tropical peatlands. Since
studies on N2O fluxes are very limited especially on peatland ecosystems, the comparison
was made with that of the drained peatland located in Sacramento, California.
Nevertheless, values acquired from Bambanin did not differ much from that of the
‘Sacramento peatland. A gross yearly N2O emission of 0.0019 Mg ha’'y"' was also recorded

in Malaysian peatlands which is within the range of he Bambanin’s N2O emission.

Determination of the rate of land use change and deforestation

Figure 28 shows the dramatic changes in the land cover and rate of deforestation of
Bambanin peatland. From 1953 to 2009 and 2009 to 2018, a decrease of 19.74% (from
16.67 has to 13.38 has) and 21.15% (from 13.38 has to 10.42 has) in the forest cover was

observed. A decrease totaling to 36.71% was estimated from 1953 to 2018.

Figure 28. Changes in the land cover and deforestation rates of Bambanin peatland
from 1953 to 2018


It was already established in past studies that deforestation is one of the major
threats on peatland degradation, The forested areas were converted to cropland and some
parts have been replaced with grasslands though time. The conversion of peatland to
cropland which entails drainage or removal of excess water from the peat soil is another
Pressure to this ecosystem. Drainage is one of the major contributors of greenhouse gas
emissions in Bambanin peatland, particularly carbon dioxide emissions. Cropland area
from 1953 was increased to 22.46% (3.21 has to 4.14 has) in 2009 but slightly decreased
(3.38%) in 2018. It can also be seen in the maps that grassland occupies the largest area
(11.93 has) within the peatland which is almost half of its total area of 27.59 has. Large
portion of the forest was converted to grassland. It has increased to 53.44% from 1953 to
2009 and a 19.70% further increase from 2009 to 2018. In one of the informal interviews
with the local people, they told that logging was very rampant long time ago when some
residents who acquired land titles decided to use the area for farming. However, they
observed that the soil was (and still is) not that suitable for farming as yields were not good.
Some did not just abandon the deforested areas but also did not take effort to replant which
could explain the expansion of the grassland areas. Even the swampy portion of the
peatland has now become a grassland. In 2009, the appearance of built-up areas (0.04 ha)
can be noticed which increased to 0.24 ha in 2018. These are small houses of residents
who do farming inside the peatland. Perennial crops like banana, coconut and other fruit
trees occupied 0.12 ha in 2009 but have increased to 0.86 ha in 2018.

The changes in various land uses and future projections by 2050 were shown in

Table 26 and were graphically shown in Figure 29. Based from the projections, forest

cover will undergo a further decrease of 15% from 10.42 has to 8.85 has by 2050. Forested
site was known to be both a sink and a source and reforestation efforts will guarantee
accumulation of more carbon in the soil that can eventually halt C losses, thus, creating

negative feedbacks on climate change.

Table 26. Land use changes in Bambanin peatland and future projections

Land Use (in hectares) 1953 2009 2018 2050
Forest 16.67 13.38 10.42 8.85
Annual crop/paddy rice 3.21 4.14 4.00 4.50
Grassland 3.46 9.58 11.93 15.35
Built-up - 0.04 0.24 0.91

Perennial crop - 0.12 0.86 3.45
Swamp 3.92 : : :

The projected expansion or 22% increase of the grassland area from 11.93 has to
15.35 has will be favorable as this will result to more carbon being stored in the peat soil
that will help improve soil properties and mitigate the effects of global warming. It was
discussed already that grassland’s roots have higher productivity compared to crops.
Increasing SOC will benefit the residents as this contributes to a higher quality of water as
well as food security as higher SOC helps increase yields.

As it is projected that croplands will increase by 11% by 2050, it will mean
reductions in SOC over time and consequently higher CO2 emissions.

‘An increase of 74% in the built-up areas and 75% in areas planted with crops is
projected to occur by 2050. It is hoped that concerned agencies and Local Government

Units (LGUs) will be stricter in the implementation of policies and regulations in

safeguarding this protected area for the benefits of humans and the environment. If these
anthropogenic activities will continue particularly the conversion of the remaining forested
areas to cropland or expansion of built-up areas within the peatland, higher emissions of

these potent greenhouse gases are very likely to happen.

Determination of level of awareness of community members surrounding the
peatland on the ecological services it provides

Socio-demographic information

Of 170 household respondents who were interviewed in Brgy. Bambanin, Victoria,
Oriental Mindoro, 82.94% was over-represented by females while only 17.06% comprised
male respondents where their level of awareness in terms of their knowledge on peatland
and its importance was measured (Figure 30). More than half of the respondents (61.18%)
are aged between 31 to 60 years old followed by those below 30 years old (23.53%) and a

relatively lower number of respondents (15.29%) belonged to the age bracket of more than

60 years old (Figure 31).

As for their marital status (Figure 32), majority of them are married that constituted

62.35% of the total number of respondents while some have live-in partners (18.24%),

widow/widower (9.41%), single (8.82%) and separated (1.18%). Almost half (41.18%) of
the respondents have been residing in the site for 5 to 30 years, 34.17% already stayed for
longer years between 31 to 60 years while others (24.12%) have been staying in the site
for less than 5 years (Figure 33). As for the houschold size, those families consisting of 1-
5 members represent 74.12% of the total number of respondents, 24.12% has 6-10

members in the family and 1.76% rarely has 11-15 household members (Figure 34).

Figure 35, Educational Attainment

The respondents’ socio-economic characteristics (Figure 36) revealed that majority
of them are not working and serve as plain housewives (25.29%), 24.12 % represent
farmers, many are skilled workers (21.76%) whose occupations are drivers, construction
workers, laborers and security guards. There are also respondents who entered into
entrepreneurial businesses (18.24%) such as mini-grocery store, parlor, buy and sell,
various shops (aluminum, junk, lamination), house renting, charcoal making, copra or

coconut oil making and tambo (Phragmites sp) making. Others (7.06%) are employed in

companies, work in Local Government Unit (LGU), baby sitter and Overseas Filipino
Workers (OFWs). Surprisingly, very few are engaged in fishing (3.53%) despite the fact
that Bambanin is just adjacent to the Naujan Lake.

When asked about their monthly income (Figure 37), results showed that more than
half (58.82%) is earning less than P5,000.00/month, which if we take P512 as the minimum
wage set by the National Wages Productivity Commission under the Department of Labor
and Employment (DOLE), is way beyond such minimum amount. Those who eam
between P5,000.00 to P10,000.00/month comprised 30.59% and only 10.59% earn more

than P10,000.00/month.

Knowledge on peatland ecosystem and its presence in Bambanin

When the respondents were asked about their knowledge on what a peatland is or

if they noticed the presence of peatland in Bambanin, 77.65% (132 respondents) answered

positively while 22.35% replied otherwise. They described peatland based on what they
observe and compared the soil and vegetation found in the uplands. Majority (96) of those
who said they know what peatland is told that peat soil is very soft (muddy) which they
attributed to the presence of more water underneath. The reason why less people are
visiting the peatland, according to them, is because of fear of being submerged in deep
mud. Ten (10) respondents mentioned that the peat soil is not suitable for farming and
although fruit trees, rice, com and other crops can grow, the yield is not good or crops do
not reach maturity and eventually die. There are actually more trees in the uplands
compared with the peatland which they sometimes termed as the lowland (9). This might
due to the fact that peatland is dominated by tambo (common reed) or Phragmites sp which
was found growing all over the area as told by seven respondents. Some (8) also observed
that the peatland water is rusty while peat soil is black (1). Despite the peat soil’s

waterlogged characteristic, fire still occurred as informed by a respondent.

Importance/Use of peatland ecosystem

The respondents were asked if peatland is of any importance to the residents and
more than half (55.29%) said that it has no use at all while 44.71% confirmed that peatland
provides the following services: a) it can be planted with rice, tuber plant (taro), banana
trees, vegetables, other peatland-associated trees like bangkal (Nauclea orientalis (L.)),
fruit trees and a variety of plants. Accordingly, it is the kind of soil that most farmers
require as it is easy to till or dig out. However, this can only be done if drainage canals are
dug to get rid of some water to make the soil more suitable for farming: b) it acts as a

sponge that absorbs water during heavy rainfall, thereby, avoids flooding in the area; c)

tambo flowers can be used in making soft whisk brooms which they sell and this becomes
a source of income for some residents; d) source of clean water; and e) peat soils are

sometimes used as fertilizers.

Factors that lead to peatland degradation

While 30.58% of the respondents do not have any idea on what degrades or destroys
Bambanin peatland, majority (69.42%) informed us that the following contribute to the
destruction of this ecosystem: a) the water's rust color (tea-like); b) the soil’s waterlogged
condition; c) the unusually deep mud; d) the presence of too much water underneath the
soil especially during rainy season; e) non-biodegradable wastes that are dumped into the
peatland area; f) land is being mismanaged; g) tillage; h) creation or establishments of a
long/huge network of drainage canals; i) cutting of trees; j) the presence of reeds or tambo
that dominate the area which as they say cover much of the peatland, thus, blocking the
penetration of sunlight needed by the soil; k) flooding and I) building of houses inside the

peatland.

Peatland fires

Compared to peatlands found in other SEA countries such as Indonesia and
Malaysia where peatland fires become a usual scenario, Bambanin peatland fire seldom
happens as only eight (4.71%) respondents were able to experience or witness it. Most of
them told that fire happened long time ago usually during summer or when the soil became
very dry, but only one said that it was in 2013 that he last witnessed a fire occurrence in

the peatland. When asked on the possible causes of fire, they mentioned that it was because

of the release of certain gases (they could not identify the kind of gas) due to the dryness
of the soil and too much heat. Agriculture that entails tillage, dry litters and heat underneath

the soil likewise contribute to peatland fires.

Peatland Agriculture

Only 30% (51) of the interviewed respondents told that they are engaged in farming
with farm lots that ranged from as small as 0.001 to 12 hectares. Out of 51 respondents,
only 22 apply fertilizers which they do once a week (1), once a month (2), once a year (1)
and 2-4 times every cropping season (18). For small farmers, most of the crops are used
for daily sustenance but a small portion is also sold for extra income that ranged from as
low as P24.00 to P2,000.00 per cropping season. Those who own a relatively large farm

lots can produce yield that can be sold from P3,000 to P45,000 per cropping season.
Probable Effects of Peatland Agriculture

The respondents were also asked if they are aware on the probable consequences
when peat soil is tilled for agriculture, its effects on the soil, air and the atmosphere. Survey
revealed that only 13.53% has knowledge about it and only few noted that soil becomes
too dry when canals are drained for agriculture. Since soil is dry, large amount of dust are
immediately released into the air when land is tilled. Some said that when peatland is
destroyed, flooding is possible to occur.

Since 38.24% of the respondents noticed these canals inside the peatland, they were
asked on the purpose why these canals were created. All of them confirmed that water is

drained from the peatland to make the soil harder and can be used for farming, water flows

in these canals. Although they already know that canals destroy the peatland, they believed
that it is the only way that peatland can be utilized for agriculture and that crops grow well
in such condition.

Nevertheless, 30.59% of the respondents told that despite the creation of more and
longer canals inside the peatland, the soil could still not be considered a very good kind
and therefore good yield and high quality of crops are always not guaranteed. However,
since most respondent-farmers rely on peatland for a living, they just accept whatever

peatland has to offer.

Conduct of Information, Education and Communication Campaign in the area

Small percentage (31.76%) of the respondents said that IEC activities were already
conducted related to peatland, Most activities were spearheaded accordingly by DENR-
CENRO Oriental Mindoro. In terms of the learnings gained from these IEC initiatives,
their answers were divided into the following: a) avoid dumping and burning wastes inside
the peatland; b) do not cut trees; c) observe safety when inside the peatland as the soil is
indeed soft and that construction of houses (using hollow blocks) is discouraged and d)

plant as many trees as possible.

What can be done to conserve and protect the peatland?

While 26.47% did not answer when questioned on what can be done to conserve
and protect the peatland, 73.52% believed that the following must be done for the purpose

of conservation: a) peatland must be protected as this helps them especially in farming

(3.53%); b) peatland must not be touched or tilled and must leave it in its natural condition
(12.94%); c) canals should be created so that water will not be stored leading to its
destruction (25.29%); d) peatland should not be made idle and use it instead for agriculture
(2.94%); e) do not let the grasses like reeds dominate the peatland (1.18%); f) do not burn
wastes (1.18%); and g) do not cut trees, planting of trees like bangkal that can survive in

the peatland ecosystem was suggested (26.47%).

ing the Level of Awareness of Bambanin residents on the peatland

As discussed in the methodology, five questions were lifted from the original
survey questionnaire to be used in determining the level of awareness of the respondents.
There were dichotomous questions answerable by Yes or No. The frequencies and

percentages the respondents’ answers to each question can be seen in Table 27.

Table 27. Level of awareness of Bambanin respondents

5. Do you know the effects of peatland drainage? 6 35.88 109 64.12


The above table shows that large proportion of the sampled population had
relatively high level of awareness of what a peatland is as well as its existence in the
Bambanin. This is in reference to the first two questions that almost had the same relative
frequency of 78%. However, when asked about the importance of the peatland ecosystem,
more than half (55.29%) did not know as reflected in their No answers. This only means
that their knowledge on peatland is limited only to its existence or presence in the area but
lack deeper understanding about it. Comparatively large percentage (64.12%) of the
respondents did not also know the negative effects of creating a network of drainage within
the peatland. Moreso, majority (86.47%) did not have any idea on what is happening in
the peat soil properties or to the atmosphere when the land is used for agriculture.
Figure 38 shows the household locations of the 170 respondents who were
interviewed for the determination of the level of awareness of local people surrounding the

peatland.

CHAPTER V

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

This research study was the first attempt to measure GHG emissions of a peatland
in the country. It was determined how agriculture, anthropogenic activities and other
peatland disturbances resulted in the imbalance of GHGs causing increased atmospheric
GHG concentrations. This study successfully met all of its objectives which are

summarized as follows:

Existing vegetation and avi-faunal composition in the peatland area

With 22 flora species belonging to 22 families and 21 avaifaunal species belonging
to 19 families, it is very evident that peatland ecosystem indeed can host a wide array of

biological diversity satisfying one of the many ecological services it provides.

Soil and water characteristics of the Bambanin peatland

The peatland water was classified under Class AA or those waters/wetlands are
found inside a protected area based on the DENR Administrative Order No. 2016-08 or the
Water Quality Guidelines and Effluent Standards of 2016. Of the six physico-chemical
properties, dissolved oxygen (DO) had the lowest concentratation observed in both seasons
of measurement that was way below the standard of Smg/L. This is very harmful to the
aquatic life found in the peatland. Another important paratemeter is the total dissolved

solids or TDS. TDS values obtained were within the acceptable levels as prescribed by

138,
WHO, US-EPA and USPHS. Peatland waters are, therefore, safe for drinking, cooking
and other household uses.

Generally, the peat soil was acidic and nutrient poor that resulted to very low quality
of produce and yields. Considering that Bambanin peatland is relatively young, organic
matter (OM) content and soil organic carbon (SOC) were comparatively low. However,
OM content of Bambanin peat soil that was between 11-19% was much higher than the
mineral soils. Such high OM content explains the high water holding capacity of the
peatland

The peat soil was dominated by sandy particles that could explain the low nutrient
contents of the soil due to leaching. In this condition, plant growth is not encouraged
because of non-retention of water and minerals in the soil.

Very low water table levels in Bambanin peatland enhanced peat decomposition
and consequently the release of CO> in the atmosphere. Sites close to drainage canals,
particularly forested and cultivated areas, had the highest water table drawdown especially
during dry season.

The computed SOC stocks that ranged between 52-132 tC/ha fell within the range
of carbon that peat soils can store. This is a clear evidence that Bambanin peatland is a
carbon sink that helps mitigate the effects of climate change. Carbon stocks found in

Bambanin are comparable to other Southeast Asian peatlands.


Greenhouse gas emissions from different land uses between seasons

The huge amount of CO2 released by the Bambanin peatland proved that this
ecosystem could also be aC source. Such emission is enhanced by anthropogenic activities
such as farming, drainage and deforestation. These human interventions are major threats
to peatland degradation. On the contratry, almost negligible amounts of CHa and N20 were

emitted by the peatland.

Rate of land-use conversion and deforestation from 1953-2018 and future scenario
projection

Deforestation that occurred from 1953-2018 estimated at a rate of 36% contributed
greatly to the high emissions of CO2 by the Bambanin peatland, Forests were mainly
converted to grasslands and croplands. Future projections indicated further deforestation
and expansion of croplands, built-up areas and areas for perennial plants would occur by
2050. If forest conversions and expansion of croplands and built-up areas will prevail in
the succeeding years, higher emissions of potent greenhouse gases to the atmosphere are

very likely to happen.

Level of awareness of the community members surrounding the peatland on the
ecological services (ES) it provides

In terms of the concept and existence of a peatland in Bambanin, respondents

tended to have a relatively high level of awareness. However, deeper understanding on the

importance of peatland and the impacts of anthropogenic activities on the overall

state/condition of the Bambanin peatland was lacking.
Recommendations

Results of this study could be used in formulating mitigation policies to address
issues on the unmanaged utilization of the peatland ecosystem including peatland
hydrology. These could also serve as baseline information for more intensive and in-depth
researches like the GHG inventory and carbon stock assessment in all the confirmed
peatlands in the country and also to contribute in the regional and global GHG inventories.
Through these efforts, widespread degradation of peatlands could be avoided while
continuous provision of ecosystem services will be ensured.

The results of the household interview that revealed a low awareness on the
importance of peatland could be addressed by the concerned agencies. This will not only
protect the sensitive peatland but will also help reduce the GHG emissions brought about
by anthropogenic activities such as deforestation, drainage and land use changes and
mitigate the probable effects of global warming to humans and the environment.

In doing in-depth peatland-related studies, the experimental design and
methodology should follow scientific protocols to be able to create acceptable statistical
data, Longer periods of observation and high sampling intensity that could generate trends
should also be made to produce more precise and reliable results. The equipment to be

used should also not limit the implementation of the set methodologies.
