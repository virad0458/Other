ABSTRACT

Fish-borne trematodes (FBT) is a group of parasitic flatworms infecting a wide
range of snail, fish, and terrestrial vertebrate hosts including humans, and infection are
common in countries where eating raw food is practiced such as the Philippines. Limited
investigation in endemic areas along with misdiagnosis makes it challenging to address
FBT infections. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the prevalence, identify risk
factors, and characterize FBTs infecting some endemic communities in Agusan del Sur and
Surigao del Norte, Mindanao. A household-based sampling was employed. Collected fecal
samples were processed and examined microscopically, then the molecular diagnosis of
microscopy-positive fecal samples was done using standard polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) targeting the internal transcribed spacer 2 region (ITS2). A total of 1,152 human
and 92 dog and cat fecal samples were examined. Overall prevalence of infection in
humans among the sites is 4.1% with higher incidence of infection in Surigao del Norte
than in Agusan del Sur (p=0.00). High prevalence was observed in municipalities of Mainit
(8.8%) and Claver (11.1%) in Surigao del Norte, where fish is popularly eaten raw or
undercooked (as kinilaw and sugba). Males were found to be more vulnerable to infection
than females (6.4% and 2% respectively [p=0.00]) due to social factors affecting the habit
of raw fish consumption. Adults have a higher risk than children (5.5% and 2% respectively
[p=0.00]), relating to the longer exposure of adults with the parasite. Furthermore, only 2%
of animals were positive, all of which are dogs. Molecular findings revealed the following
species: Haplorchis taichui, Stellenthchasmus falcatus, and Opisthorchis viverrini. This is
the first molecular research on FBTs in the country. This study identified susceptible
groups and underlying risk factors, and utilized more accurate diagnostic tools to help take
steps forward in breaking the cycle of infection through providing specific areas for a more
targeted FBT control.

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION

Fish-borne trematode (FBT) is a parasitic flatworm or helminth that uses fresh or
brackish water fish as an intermediate host. It comprises of a diverse group of helminths
infecting the liver and intestines in humans and constitute a major public health concern.
They infect a wide range of snail, fish, and terrestrial vertebrate hosts, in particular,
companion animals such as dogs and cats. The terrestrial vertebrate hosts shed the parasite
eggs, and then develop inside the first intermediate host (a snail). The parasite then emerges
and swims towards the second intermediate host (a fish) where it encysts as a larva.
Humans and other definitive hosts ultimately get infected through ingestion of metacercaria
larva lodged in raw or improperly cooked freshwater or brackish water fish (Chai, 2007;
Mahdy et al., 2021), and environmental contamination through improper disposal of fecal
waste is the common source of transmission. Some major FBTs of medical importance
include the liver flukes (Family Opisthorchiidae) — Opisthorchis viverrini, Opisthorchis
felineus, Clonorchis sinensis, and intestinal flukes (Family Heterophyidae) — Heterophyes
heterophyes, Haplorchis taichui, Centrocestus formosanus, Metagonimus yokogawai, and

Stellanthchasmus falcatus.

Around 7 million people worldwide are believed to be infected with FBTs (World
Health Organization [WHO], 2021), but most of the infected are in Southeast Asia
including the Philippines, particularly in areas where eating raw food is practiced (Chai et

al., 2009; Trung Dung et al., 2007). Infection with FBTs may have various manifestations

such as indigestion, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or constipation (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention [CDC], 2019). Chronic infections involve symptoms associated with the
organ to which the adult worm is located. For instance, obstructive jaundice, hepatomegaly
are observed in individuals with severe case of liver fluke (Keiser and Utzinger, 2009),
whereas symptoms associated with intestinal flukes are similar to peptic ulcer (Belizario et
al., 2004). Although usually asymptomatic, migration to other organs (e.g., brain and heart)
and even death has been reported in individuals that are heavily infected (i.e.,
heterophyids). Coinfection with other parasites in human and animal hosts may also occur

(Fried and Abruzzi, 2010).

Diagnosis of FBTs is still an ongoing problem because of the inadequacy in using
morphological approach in discriminating parasite eggs, especially with closely-related
species of superfamily Opisthorchoidea (Dung et al., 2007). Coupled with low awareness
of the community and health workers in this group, its true burden is thus underestimated.
Limited molecular research has also been conducted, and updated epidemiological data and
intervention efforts have been more difficult to achieve as recognition is the first and
important control point for addressing intestinal parasitosis (Chai and Jung, 2017; Eduardo,

2001).

As one of the contributing agents in the decline of health and economic alleviation,
lack of updated knowledge on FBT infections due to misdiagnosis and slow progress in its
taxonomic characterization, makes it challenging to address years long of intestinal
helminth problem, especially in endemic areas such as in Mindanao, Philippines.

Furthermore, deep-rooted influence of socioeconomic and sociocultural aspects pose a

great obstacle in controlling such infections. Up to date, there has been limited attempt to
determine possible risk factors of FBT infection in northeastern Mindanao. This will also

be the first molecular identification of FBT in the country.

Unspecified FBT infections and underappreciation of its socioeconomic relevance
push the neglect in addressing such infections. This study investigated the occurrence of
FBTs infecting some endemic communities in Caraga Region in Mindanao. The specific

objectives of this study were to:

1.) determine the prevalence of human and animal FBT infection;

3.) associate some knowledge, attitude and practices as possible risk factors of FBT
infections in the communities; and

2.) characterize the FBT isolates through molecular and phylogenetic analysis using

internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) marker.

CHAPTER II

REVIEW OF LITERATURE CITED

Fish-borne trematode (FBT)

Fish-borne trematodes are parasitic flatworms or helminths that use fresh or
brackish water fish as intermediate host. FBTs are among the most common parasitic
infections in humans and animals but are less associated with mortality than many other
parasites. Due to this, FBTs are deemed as one of the Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD)
despite the risk to human health. Infection is caused by liver flukes (including Clonorchis,
Opisthorchis) or intestinal flukes (Heterophyid and Gymnophallids). Approximately 59
species of fish-borne trematodes have been reported to infect humans (Hung, Madsen &
Fried, 2013). Furthermore, out of all FBTs, Opisthorchiids and Heterophyids are the closest
in terms of phylogeny, life cycle, as well as egg morphology. This brings about issues not

only on a public health stance, but also with its diagnosis and taxonomy.

Currently, Opisthorchiids have 20 species, and three of the major ones are
Opisthorchis viverrini, Opisthorchis felineus, and Clonorchis sinensis. On the otherhand,
intestinal helminth Heterophyids include 28 species, 15 are considered zoonotic. Some of
the medically important species include: Metagonimus yokogawai, Heterophyes nocens,
Heterophyes heterophyes, Centrocestus formosanus and Haplorchis taichui (Chai et al.,

2013; Chai and Jung, 2020).

Fish-borne trematodiasis is the infection caused by FBTs. Infections are usually
asymptomatic or mild, however, this emerging disease could cause complications
especially with high worm burden. Liver flukes, particularly O. viverrini, increases the risk
for diabetes mellitus and cholangiocarnicoma or cancer of the bile duct (Thinkhamrop et
al., 2021). Clonorchis sinensis has been documented to cause pancreatitis (Choi et al.,
2015) and acute shock (Wang et al., 2019). In addition, although intestinal trematodes are
generally considered not as clinically important as the liver flukes, it can cause ulceration,
excessive secretion of mucus and necrosis of the intestinal epithelium, chronic diarrhea,
nausea, and weight loss. Eggs of heterophyids sometimes enter the bloodstream and cause
serious pathology to the heart, brain and spinal cord (Africa and Garcia, 1935). In 1997, it
is believed that 15% of the cases of fatal myocarditis in the Philippines are caused by

heterophyid infection (Garcia and Bruckner, 1997).

Biology and transmission routes

FBTs follow a similar indirect life cycle which requires three hosts — a snail, a fish,
and a bird or mammalian host. The general life cycle of FBTs is shown on Figure 1. The
first intermediate host of Clonorchis belongs to the genera: Parafossarulus, Bulinus,
Semisulcospira, Alocinma, Thiara, and Melanoides. Opisthorchiids on the otherhand
require snails belonging to the Bithynia genus (Belizario and Ciro, 2020), and Batillaria,
Cerithideopsilla, Melania, Pironella, Semisulcospira, and Tympanotomus (Eduardo, 2001)
for heterophyids. The aquatic snail host ingests the mature eggs containing the ciliated

larval stage (miracidia). The miracidia emerges from the eggs and penetrate the snail’s

small intestine. The parasite develops to its free-swimming larval stage (cercaria) and is
released from the snail host. The cercaria is then transmitted to its second intermediate host

by skin penetration, and encysts as metacercaria in the fish host tissue.

Figure 1. General life cycle of fish-borne trematodes. Definitive hosts are infected by ingesting
uncooked or inadequately cooked fish with encysted metacercaria. Metacercaria excysts in the small
intestine wherein they develop as adult flukes. Embryonated eggs are deposited in the water via feces
and miracidium hatches, infecting the first intermediate host. The miracidia develop into sporocysts,

then rediae. The rediae emerge as cercariae which penetrates the second intermediate fish host.

The second intermediate host may be a freshwater or brackish water fish. In the
Philippines, many common food fishes have been shown to harbor the infective

metacercariae of these trematodes, including but not limited to dalag (Channa striata),

bangus (Chanos chanos), hito (Clarias batrachus), lapu-lapu (Epinephelus corollicola),
and tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) (Eduardo, 2001; El-Seify et al., 2021; Mahdy et al.,
2021). Liver flukes share some species of second intermediate host with intestinal flukes,
particularly freshwater cyprinids (Belizario and Ciro, 2020). Mode of infection of the
definitive host is through ingestion of fish encysted with metacercaria, and the parasite

excysts and attach either to the liver or the intestine.

The snail is deemed the critical host because of its specificity, while the parasite is
less selective regarding the second intermediate host, which can be one of a number of fish
species found in fresh, brackish, or salt water (Pan American Health Organization [PAHO],
2003). Depending on the parasite species, the definitive hosts may be fish-eating birds
(Farahnak, 2004), or mammalian hosts such as rodents, dogs, cats, and humans.
Environmental contamination with human or animal feces ensures completion of the

parasite’s life cycle.

The geographical range of the infection are expanding because of the rapid growth
of the fish industry, improved transportation systems, and population movements (Chai et
al. 2005), culture exchange, environmental modification and sanitation problems, and
especially the inadequate food safety monitoring in the market, also contributes to the
increase in transmission of such parasites. Granting all this, complete biology and
distribution for some species remain unknown (Chai and Jung, 2020). Further
investigations are required to determine intermediate hosts for some species and elucidate

transmission modalities.

Epidemiology of fish-borne trematodes in Asia

More than 160 million people worldwide are said to be at risk for FBT infections
(Chai, 2009; Keiser and Utzinger, 2009). An estimate of 10 million are infected with
Opisthorchis spp. and 15.3 million with Clonorchis spp. (Nithikathkul et al., 2021; Qian et
al., 2012) and 50 million infected with intestinal flukes (Chai et al., 2009). Occasional cases
have been reported in other countries but FBTs are mostly endemic to the Southeast Asia
and the Far East, primarily in China, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines or
Thailand. Clonorchis is predominantly found in Vietnam and China with 1.23 million
people infected (Furst et al., 2012). Opisthorchis is highly endemic in Laos, Cambodia,
and Thailand, with prevalence reaching up to 90% in Laos (Sithithaworn et al., 2012).
Similarly, heterophyids have the highest prevalence recorded in East and Southeast Asia
(Dung et al., 2007), with 65% infected in Thailand and Vietnam (Dung et al., 2007; Sohn
et al., 2014), and 55% in the Philippines (Belizario et al., 2001). Although most infections
are in Asian countries, population migration and tourism may expand the geographical

distribution of infections of these parasites.

It is believed that a higher number of individuals are infected with intestinal flukes
than liver flukes, although their true burden is underestimated due to the similarity of its
eggs with some of the more pathological species of FBTs (Hung et al., 2015). Difficulty
of differentiating eggs from those of the liver flukes in human fecal examinations may

cause inaccurate estimates of the prevalence of both trematode groups. Updated surveys

and a more sensitive detection are urgently required for better understanding of the global

status and public health significance of FBTs.

Infection status in the Philippines

To the extent of this review, there are currently 10 FBT species recorded in the
Philippines: C. sinensis, O. felineus, O. viverrini, Haplorchis taichui, H. vanissima, H.
taihoku, H. yokogawai, Procerovum calderoni, Stellanthchasmus falcatus and
Diorchitrema pseudocirrata (Balderia and Belizario, 2012; Belizario, 2022; Chai and Jung,
2017; Eduardo, 2001). Heterophyid incidence have been recorded in provinces Negros
Oriental, Bukidnon, Compostela Valley in Mindanao. Belizario et al. (2001) reported 55%
prevalence, and 36% in 2004, while recent reports by Moendeg et al. (2021) and Belizario

et al., (2022) showed an overall prevalence ranging to 2% to 10%.

With the exemption of the survey done by Belizario et al. in 2022, most reports on
FBT focused on Southern Mindanao where the custom of eating raw fish is common.
Moreover, reports have yet specified species identity due to low specificity diagnosis using
Kato—Katz technique or Formalin-Ether Concentration Technique (FECT) (Belizario et al.,

2004).


Fish-borne trematodiasis in animals

Animals play an important role in the transmission cycle as they can contaminate
the environment with various parasites and hence, determining their infection status is also
crucial. Prevalence of intestinal helminths in various hosts have been determined in some

areas (El Seify, 2020; Farahnak et al., 2004; Lahmar et al., 2017; Nissen et al., 2014).

Infection of Opisthorchis viverrini in dogs and cats have been recorded
(Tangkawattana and Tangkawattana, 2018), with a prevalence of 35% in Thailand, and up
to 60% in southern Vietnam (Sithithawom et al., 2012). Dogs infected with C. sinensis
were as high as 42% in China (Lin et al., 2011). In Tunisia, North Africa, 1.47% of stray
dogs are also infected with H. heterophyes (Lahmar et al., 2017), which was the first record
of the parasite in the country. Moreover, a study in Vietnam noted that within 3 months
after treatment, 50% of dogs sampled have been reinfected with FBTs due to easy access
to raw fish (Nissen et al., 2014). In Kuwait, 59 (24.6%) stray cats were found to be infected
with 14 species of FBTs and all recovered trematodes are considered zoonotic (El-Azazy
2015). Artificial infection has also demonstrated that cats were more susceptible to
infection, and showed more severe pathological signs compared with rats (El Seify, 2020).
These results highlight the importance of animals as carriers of FBTs. There is no available
data yet on the prevalence of infection in animals in the Philippines. Such data is crucial

for better understanding of the infection dynamics and for improved intervention strategies.


Socioeconomic determinants

Risk behaviors are often mediated by various socioeconomic determinants such as
limited access to treatment, safe water source and latrine coverage (Bardosh et al., 2014).
For parasites such as Soil Transmitted Helminths (STH) and Schistosoma, infections have
been mostly associated with poor sanitation and low socioeconomic status, specifically the
lack of access to clean and safe water and latrine (Hotez et al., 2006; Pasaribu et al., 2019).
As a result, some resort to open defecation. Helminth infections are thus maintained due to
continuous contamination in the environment. Similarly in the case of FBTs,

socioeconomic status also plays a role.

As earlier discussed, FBT infections in humans are mainly caused by eating raw or
undercooked fish. Such practice may be traditionally rooted, consumed in a religious
context, or simply a personal taste preference (Bardosh et al., 2014). In terms of
demographics, Xu et al. (2021) found an association among gender, age, ethnic group,
education level and occupation for risk of acquiring FBT. Moendeg et al. (2021) reported
a higher heterophyid infection rate in males than females, and in ages 45-60, although
Parija et al. (2003) found that children were more susceptible to severe symptoms. Also in
contrast with schistosomiasis and STH infections, nonfarmers such as drivers and soldiers
showed the highest percentage of FBT infection. Proximity of the households to rivers is
also a socioeconomically-linked factor. Households were found to obtain fish in the

parasite-contaminated river instead of buying in the market for consumption (Moendeg et


al., 2021). Further, proximity to bodies of water denotes high risk for fecal contamination,

ensuring continuity of parasite life cycle.

There has only been one study on risk factors for FBT infection in the country,
specifically on Heterophyids in Southern Mindanao (Moendeg et al., 2021). Further study
of other possible risk factors in other parasite-endemic areas in the country are also needed

to address the biosocial complexities of helminth control.

Diagnosis and treatment

In spite of the need for more sensitive diagnosis, the Kato-katz technique (Katz,
1972) remains the standard method for intestinal helminth detection worldwide. It is widely
used in epidemiological surveys and monitoring of intervention programs for STH and
schistosomiasis (Turner et al., 2017). It is cheaper and more accessible, although this type
of coprological assessment is reliable only when the intensity of infection is high and

accurate diagnosis highly depends on the familiarity of the microscopist with the parasite.

There has been a lack of standardization and quality assurance in diagnosis. Since
the eggs and larvae of FBTs are highly similar, acquiring adult worms through purgation
is one of the options used for definitive diagnosis and confirmation of species. However,
this approach is not amenable for determining infection prevalence (Johansen 2010).
Nonetheless, Lee et al. (2012) have found that minute surface ridges on Metagonimus spp.,

H. continua, H. nocens, and S. falcatus eggs, vary with C. sinensis in terms of prominence.


However, using these morphological distinctions would be less accurate than molecular
diagnosis. The eggs of H. heterophyes and M. yokogawai, as well as those of Clonorchis
and Opisthorchis, are all virtually indistinguishable (PAHO 2003). The surface structure
of the eggs is found to be a more reliable criterion than traditional morphology, but it is
more difficult to visualize using standard microscopy. In Metagonimus spp., H. continua,
H. nocens, and S. falcatus eggs, minute surface ridges were recognizable though less
prominent compared with C. sinensis (Lee et al., 2012). Field surveys reporting human
infections in the Philippines (Belizario 2001, 2004; Moendeg et al., 2021), and other
endemic countries in East Asia and Southeast Asia utilize fecal detection using Kato-Katz
technique, although some studies also performed purgation to recover adult worms

(Belizario, 2022; Chai et al., 2014; Nguyen et al., 2009).

Quantifying eosinophilia in blood tests is also used an indication of parasite
infection, which is commonly employed for travelers and migrants. In case of moderate to
severe eosinophilia, patients are advised to take stool samples for examination if other risk
factors (such as travel to an endemic region and eating raw fish) are present (Ehrhardt and
Burchard, 2008). Serological assays may have potential for the diagnosis of infection when
eggs cannot be detected at all times in the fecal samples while antibodies release within a
few days of parasitic infections (El-Seify et al., 2011). Attempts to develop detection based
on immunological principles (i.e. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have been

made. However, cross-reactions may occur (Ehrhardt and Burchard, 2008; Hegazy, 2020).


Along with other intestinal helminths, FBTs can be treated with praziquantel. It is
an effective and easy to manage anti-helminthic drug. However, the duration of
administering the drug differs depending on the trematode present. The dosage is 75mg per
kg body weight taken in three doses (of 25mg/kg) administered for one day (for
heterophyids) or two to three days (for Opisthorchiids) (Belizario and de Leon, 2015; Parija
et al. 2003). Trematodes are directly killed by praziquantel and the worms are easily
discharged along with feces. Mass drug treatment (MDA) is usually administered twice a
year in endemic communities such as in Mindanao, Philippines (Mationg et al., 2021),
although non-compliance defeats the purpose of such intervention strategy and allows local
transmission to prevail (Bardosh et al., 2014). Aside from preventive chemotherapy,
countermeasures such as educating the public about the danger of eating raw or
undercooked fish or meat is done (Hong and Yong, 2020). On another note, the recent
COVID-19 pandemic affected the MDA campaign in the Philippines and hence, it is
expected that parasite infections will increase and more sustainable control strategies are

needed (Mationg et al., 2021).

FBTs have never been a target of deworming on public health stance (Hong and
Yong, 2020) and much less attention has been given to parasite control for the animal
reservoir hosts. Regular deworming of animals are recommended, although such an
approach requires huge funds. Parasite control is particularly challenging for stray animals.
Other approaches are fertility control and use of praziquantel baits, which are both
economically and logistically difficult to implement in developing countries (Nissen et al.,

2014). Despite the challenges, parasite infection in animals should also be taken into


consideration when control programs are to be established (Nissen et al., 2013, 2014).
Identification of barriers and challenges in parasite control through incorporating the

underlying socioeconomic factors is also needed.

Molecular studies and phylogenetic position

As one of the neglected tropical diseases, there has also been limited reliable data
on the epidemiology and characterization of FBTs, especially in the Philippines. For
instance, the systematic position and the most recent morphological studies on various
Philippine heterophyid metacercaria was way back in the 1940s (Vasquez-Colet & Africa,
1940). Meanwhile in nearby Southeast Asian countries such as in Vietnam and Thailand,
FBTs have well been described epidemiologically and morphologically, but molecular data

useful for identification and taxonomy are also limited, particularly for intestinal flukes.

Molecular studies on FBTs primarily focused on detection of different species and
molecular differentiation, since misdiagnosis is a common occurrence on this group of
parasites. In Myanmar, the use of molecular-based methods enabled the identification of
O. viverrini for the first time in 2017 (Aung et al., 2017). Among liver flukes, different
techniques were developed to efficiently distinguish Opisthorchis and Clonorchis eggs.
Sun et al. (2011) optimized a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based multiplex ligation-
dependent probe amplification (MPLA), which is a rapid and specific detection of single
nucleotide acid difference. Different yields of amplicons were generated among species

and no cross-reaction occurred. Multiplex assay has also been utilized for Opisthorchiids


and Heterophyids using metacercaria isolated from fish in single reaction, which is rapid
and cost effective, compared with inefficient and expensive PCR and sequencing-based
methods (Caffara et al., 2020). Serological tools have also been developed to screen
Opisthorchis and Clonorchis, and among the recent advances include the use of
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies from human blood (Sadaow et al., 2022). This enables
rapid detection in areas that are endemic for Opisthorchiasis. On the other hand, there is
still no successfully developed antigen that would distinguish heterophyids from other food
borne parasites. This is essential due to differential treatment depending on the parasite
(i.e. heterophyid and opisthorchiid flukes would require different doses of praziquantel
treatment). Possible cross-reactivity between heterophyid Pygidiopsis geneta and blood
fluke Schistosoma spp. has also been noted by Hegazy (2020).

More importantly, development of markers to identify species has also progressed.
Although a lot of markers were developed for detection, it has been found that 28S
ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions
are more reliable than mitochondrial DNA as markers for heterophyids and some
opisthorchiids (Santos and Borges, 2020). Molecular tools allowed some ecological
research such as the detection of Haplorchis taichui in field-collected snails
(Chontananarth & Wongsawad, 2010), tracking life cycle stages of heterophyids in fishes
(both molecular and morphometric methods (Skov et al., 2009). Furthermore, DNA data
has also enabled revision and updates on the phylogenetic status of Opisthorchiids using
NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (nad1), cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (cox1), 18S and

28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequence analyses (Dao et al., 2017). Similarly,


molecular phylogeny of trematodes in family Heterophyidae based on cox] and ribosomal
transcription units (rTU) 18S, ITS1, 5.8s, 28S rRNA genes (Chontananarth et al., 2014; Le
et al., 2017), although it has been noted that reevaluation of phylogenetic tree using both
molecular and morphological approach is needed (Le et al, 2017) and data from additional
FBT species are necessary to create a higher resolution phylogeny (Dao et al., 2017).

Because of the diversity and variability of FBTs in terms of pathogenicity, detection
methods are also highly variable among different species. More pathogenic organisms also
receive a lot of attention in terms of molecular aspect, however some FBTs still lack
primers and reference sequence for other species (Duflot et al., 2021). Improved diagnostic
tools are urgently needed, especially those that can differentiate the various species.

As this group still requires substantial re-evaluation using a combination of
morphological and molecular data (Le et al., 2017), this study aims to detect sequences that
could aide in the better understanding of these neglected fish-borme parasites. Endemic
communities need better management and disease prevention instruments starting with the
appropriate surveillance. The use of molecular approaches will provide new insights for
the development of diagnostic tools, as well as future research such as drug development.
Generated data will also give light to the real status of infection and updates on Philippine
isolates will hopefully find clues on the taxonomy and phylogenetic status of this phyla,

together with the isolates from other countries.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study site

The study was conducted in the northeastern part of Mindanao, specifically in
Region 13 (Caraga). It is composed of five provinces: Agusan del Norte, Agusan del Sur,
Surigao del Norte, Surigao del Sur, and Dinagat Islands. The agriculture, fishery and
forestry sector is Caraga’s economic banner, particularly in Agusan del Sur (agro-forestry
center and food basket) and Surigao del Norte (major ecotourism destination and fishery
producer). Agusan del Sur and Surigao del Norte also remain endemic for soil transmitted
helminthiasis, schistosomiasis, and food borne helminthiasis (Mationg et al., 2021; Owada
et al., 2018). Four municipalities from each province were selected as recommended by the
Department of Health (DOH). Selection was based on endemicity or high parasite infection
status, cooperation of the local government unit, accessibility of the communities and peace

and order situation.

Sampling design

A household-based sampling was employed, using a cross-sectional mixed method
approach. To determine heterophyid infection status in each chosen municipality, a
minimum number of 188 participants from 38 households were calculated. The sample size
was computed using a predicted prevalence of intestinal helminth infection of 50%, a

confidence level of 95%, an accuracy of 5%, an average household size of 5, and 10%


adjustment for noncompliance. The households were randomly selected from each
municipality with the assistance of the Municipal Social Welfare and Development Office
(MSWDO). Participants of ages 10-59 were selected for diagnosis. Mentally and physically
challenged individuals and pregnant women were excluded to participate in the study. The
target number of samples is 1,504, however, the actual number of participants for this study
is 1152; distributed as follows: 168 in Bunawan, 145 in Trento, 120 in Bayugan, 133 in
Esperanza, 181 in Mainit, 169 in San Isidro, 126 in Claver, and 110 in Gigaquit.
Companion animals owned by the participating household or their neighbors were also
included to determine possible transmission. A total of 92 animal fecal samples (72 dogs

and 20 cats ) were collected non-invasively.

Ethical clearance

Prior to the collection of samples, approval permits from selected Local
Government Units (LGUs) and Gratuitous Permit (GP) from the Department of Agriculture
(DA) were secured. Ethical clearance was obtained from the University of the Philippines
Manila Research Ethics Board (UPMREB 2019-084-01) (ANNEX A) and Institutional
Animal Care Use for Research Committee (CAS 2018-020) (ANNEX B). Consent and
assent forms were secured and voluntary participation and withdrawal from the study at
any time without implication were also ensured. Samples were also assigned with codes to

ensure confidentiality of the participants.


Collection and processing of fecal samples

Fecal samples from human participants from the municipalities were obtained with
the assistance of DOH and barangay health workers. Approximately 20g of fecal samples
were collected from each participant. Samples were labelled and stored in 60mL fecal
containers, and were transported to the designated field laboratory for processing. Human
fecal samples were analyzed using the Kato-Katz method (Katz, 1972). Animal fecal
samples were collected non-invasively and processed using McMaster technique (Zajac
and Conboy, 2012). Suspected FBT eggs were counted and multiplied by a factor of 24 to
approximate the number of eggs present per gram (epg) of feces for Kato-Katz, and
multiplied by a factor of 50 for McMaster. Quality control was done to ensure accurate
diagnosis of parasite eggs. All fecal samples were then preserved in absolute ethanol for

transport and molecular analysis.

Survey administration

Interviews were conducted to determine the potential risk factors of FBT infection.
Questions include demographic profiles, exposure and practices, as well as knowledge,
attitude, and perception (KAPs) related to food and water borne helminthiasis which
include the FBTs. Prevention and treatment seeking behavior were also included to
determine gaps for effective intervention strategies. Household heads were chosen to
participate in the interview as decision-makers of the family, usually the father. In cases

where both parents decide in the family, whoever is available was interviewed.


Questionnaires were translated to Cebuano as the local dialect and pre-tested before
administration. The data were transcribed and summarized in Excel. Respondents were

also assigned codes to ensure data privacy.

Analysis for parasitological assessment and interview data

From the results of the parasitological assessment, the parasite prevalence and mean

intensity were computed using the following formula:

Prevalence (%) = Number of infected_x100
Number of examined

Mean Intensity= Number of parasites
Number of infected

The intensity of infection was classified as follows: Light infection (1-100 epg), Moderate

infection (101-1000 epg), and Heavy infection (>1000 epg) (Belizario et al., 2001).

To compare parasite egg prevalence and intensity among location, sex, and age, a
Chi-square test was done at p-value < 0.05 significance. Chi-square test of independence
was also performed to identify any significant association between questionnaire responses
and parasitological results. Subsequently, factors which had a p-value < 0.05 were included
in a logistic regression model to measure the strength of association among risk factors,
with the parasitological results as an outcome. Model fit was evaluated by means of
likelihood ratio testing. A p-value of less than 0.05 was also considered significant. On the

other hand, the KAP data generated from the interview were analyzed using descriptive


statistics. All statistical analysis was done using STATA version 13 (STATA 13 ®, Stata

Corp, Texas, USA).

Molecular detection using standard PCR

Molecular detection was used to screen positive samples and to obtain the sequence
for species identification. It was also employed to assess possible presence of the parasite
which was undetected through microscopy. DNA from the stool samples was isolated using
a DNA isolation kit (QIAGEN DNeasy® PowerSoil® Pro), following the manufacturer’s
protocol. Pre-extraction was done by homogenizing the stool sample transferred in the kit’s
zirconium bead tube for three minutes using a beadbeater (Benchmark D2400-E
BeadBlaster). A standard polymerase chain reaction was done to amplify the ITS regions
of the parasite DNA. ITS region was selected as it is highly conserved and allows
characterization of digeneans such as liver flukes and minute intestinal flukes, at different
category levels. ITS2 is said to be highly conserved at species level, whereas the variability
(Waikagul and Thaenkham, 2014). A pre-made PCR master mix (1‘t Base exTEN® 2X )
was used to amplify the ITS2 regions. The primers used are shown on Table 1, and the
computed PCR cocktail is indicated on Table 2.

A standard PCR was conducted using a thermocycler with the conditions set on
Table 3. The PCR reaction was run for 35x cycles. The generated amplicons were resolved
by agarose gel electrophoresis (FisherBrand) at 100v for 30min and the bands were viewed

and photographed using UV transilluminator (Maestrogen). All positive amplicons for ITS


2 were then packaged for outsourced Sanger sequencing (Apical Scientific Sequencing,

Malaysia).

DNA sequence analysis and phylogenetic tree construction

The sequences of amplicons were cleaned and concatenated using MEGA X
software and inferred to those sequences available in molecular repositories online (i.e.,
GenBank). BLAST search was conducted for species identification and selection of other

sequences for phylogenetic analysis.

Sequences from this study and from other representatives under the superfamily
Opisthorchoidea were aligned using ClustalW. The alignment file in FASTA format was
imported to MEGA X software, and a tree was constructed to determine the phylogenetic
position of Philippine FBTs relative to other trematodes. The evolutionary history was
inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method and Kimura 2-parameter model
(Kimura, 1980). The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1000 replicates is taken to
represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed (Felsenstein, 1985). The rate
variation model allowed from some sites to be evolutionarily invariable (I). Echinostoma

miyagawai (MH796365) was chosen as the outgroup.

CHAPTER IV

RESULTS

Prevalence and intensity

Epidemiological surveys on food-borne trematodes are given less regard compared
to other parasitic infections such as soil-transmitted helminths and schistosomiasis.
Limited case-finding and non-specific detection of FBTs hinder the realization of its status
and public health significance, especially in the Philippines. Therefore, this study
conducted a survey to estimate the prevalence of FBTs in Northeastern Mindanao. Kato
Katz method was performed to determine the infection status among selected sites in the
provinces Agusan del Sur (ADS) and Surigao del Norte (SDN). The results are shown

below (Table 4).

A total of 1,152 participants belonging to 386 households were selected. Overall, 47
individuals (4.1%) were positive with FBT eggs. A higher parasite prevalence was
observed in the province of Surigao del Norte, particularly in municipalities Mainit and
Claver (X?=34.50, p=0.00), although a higher parasite burden was observed in Agusan del
Sur, particularly in Esperanza. There is a significant difference in heterophyid infections
between provinces (X?=10.30, p=0.00) and among municipalities (X7=34.50, p=0.00).
Furthermore, more males (6.4%) are infected with FBT eggs than females (2%) (X7=14.21,
p=0.00), and adults were highly infected (5.5%) than children (2%) (X*=9.02, p=0.00)
(Figure 2). A light to moderate infection was also observed across all sites. On another
note, out of 92 animal fecal samples examined, only two animal fecal samples were
positive with FBT eggs (2%). Specifically, one dog from Trento in Agusan del Sur and one

dog from Mainit, Surigao del Norte.

Potential risk factors of fish-borne trematodes


Fish-borne infections are mainly linked to consumption of contaminated fish foods,

although patterns of exposure vary among different communities. In this study, a household

interview was conducted to identify possible risk factors associated with fish-bome parasite

infection. A total of 386 household heads participated in the interview. Table 5 summarizes

the potential risk factors in relation with the infection status.

*Significant, p<0.05


Results show that exposure to cats and dogs were a significant factor, as presence
of cats or dogs around the households were observed to have higher infection than those
without cats and dogs (12.4%, p=0.03). Presence of more dogs also has a higher infection
(10.10%, p=0.05). It is also interesting to note that higher infection rates were observed in
households who did not avail medication (25%) and laboratory diagnosis (33%) than those
who availed both services, although no significant relationship was observed (p=0.15 and

p=0.06, respectively).

However, the frequency of eating raw or undercooked fish was not a statistically
significant variable in acquiring the infection, i.e. 11.6% of the respondents who claim
never to consume raw or undercooked fish were still infected (p=0.43) (Table 5). While so,
respondents that eat raw fish identified ‘kilaw’ as the top food preparation practice, and

some also answered ‘sugba’ or grilling fish over heated charcoal (Figure 3).

Moreover, no significant relationship exists between infection status and the
practice or method of cooking (X?= 2.25, p=0.32), as well as the frequency (X?=3.16,
p=0.37) of having raw or undercooked fish dishes. Some of the fish that are mostly
consumed raw are indicated in Table 6. The top fish consumed raw or undercooked is
Sardine (Sardinella spp., local name: Tamban), followed by Skipjack tuna (Family
Scombridae, local name: Bariles) and Flying fish (Family Exocoetidae, local name:

Bangsi). Others also mentioned eating raw pork and squid.

Statistically significant demographic and risk factors presented previously were
used in the logistic regression model to determine its association to FBT infection. Results

show that location, sex and age were all significant factors in having FBT infection (Table

).

Households in Mainit, Surigao del Norte are 20.05 times more likely to have FBT
infection, and households in Claver are 15.54 times more likely to get infected (p=0.01)
than in other municipalities. Furthermore, males have 0.30 times higher risk, while there is
1.86 times higher risk for adults in acquiring the infection. On the other hand, the presence
of cats and dogs increases the risk of heterophyid infection by 2.60 times (p=0.05),
although an increase in the number of dogs is not a significant factor in increasing the risk

of humans getting FBT infection (Table 7).

Knowledge, attitude, and perception on fish-borne trematodes

For public health interventions to successfully encourage and sustain preventive
behaviors among the endemic communities, evidence on factors associated with the
behavior in the community is essential. At present, there is limited information on how
such factors affect vulnerability to fish-borne trematodiasis, yet alone intestinal
helminthiasis.

In this study, the KAPs of participants were determined through household
interviews and descriptive analysis. As shown in Table 8, nearly all of the respondents
(80%) are aware of the food and water-borne helminthiasis (FWBH). Only 4% did not have
an idea on how they can get infected with it. Although most respondents were able to
identify that FWBH can be acquired by eating contaminated or raw food (19%), some
mentioned contact with soil, water and animals as causative factors. Furthermore,

abdominal pain and vomiting (39%), as well as diarrhea and bloody stool (21%) were the


top-most perceived health effects of FWBH — such symptoms that are also related to STH

and SCH infections.

In their knowledge on the capacity of health centers to address FWBH, more than

half are aware of the availability of medication (64%) but only 50% know about the


availability of diagnosis for food and waterborne parasites. Overall, there is a positive
attitude towards seeking treatment and prevention against FWBH. Majority of the
respondents find FWBH as a potentially fatal infection (94%). As such, a relatively higher
percentage (72%) say that they are willing to go to the health center or hospital for
treatment if they experience symptoms. Only 5% claim that they would seek treatment
upon experiencing severe symptoms. On the other hand, among the respondents that refuse
to seek treatment when they get infected, 87% said that their refusal would be a result of

not having enough money for the treatment.

Molecular identification

Molecular characterization is essential to differentiate parasites with identical egg
morphology, as commonly observed among trematodes. In this study, the ITS markers
were used to detect and confirm which species of FBTs are present in Northeastern
Mindanao. Out of the 35 samples that were run on PCR, 19 were positive for ITS2
molecular detection. In addition, no amplicons were detected from the two animal samples
that were positive for FBT eggs in microscopy. The figure below shows the PCR products
of parasite eggs isolated from fecal samples of humans (Figure 4). Two distinct band sizes

were observed: ~350bp and 480bp.

trematode eggs isolated from human fecal samples with Lanes 1-2: Haplorchis taichui.
Lanes 3,4: Opisthorchis viverrini, Lanes 5,6: Stellanthchasmus falcatus.

Three different species of parasites shown on Figure 4 were revealed using Blast
similarity search (Table 9). Based on sequencing results, the detected parasites were (1)
Opisthorchis viverrini, which is a liver fluke and a fish borne parasite, and the heterophyids
(2) Haplorchis taichui and (3) Stellanthchasmus falcatus. Among the species detected in
previous study by Sato et al. (2010) in Laos, this is the first record of S. falcatus detected
using the same primer set. Haplorchis taichui on the other hand, has been previously
recorded and known to be endemic in the Philippines (Belizario, 2001).

As observed in Figure 4, there is an evident difference between the band sizes for
ITS2 regions, except for O. viverrini and S. falcatus. which have a similar band size of

~350bp.

inferred using Maximum Likelihood analysis with the K2+I model (best fit model of nucleotide
substitution: K2: Kimura 2 Parameter, G: gamma distribution) and nodal support estimated using 1000
bootstrap resampling. Bootstrap values: >90% strongly supported, 70-90% well supported, 50-70%
weakly supported, <50% not supported.


Overall, the topology of the phylogenetic tree inferred from 21 sequences in this
study generally agreed well with previous studies (Le et al., 2017; Thaenkham et al., 2011).
Figure 4 shows that the sequences of all three species isolated in this study are grouped
with those of the same species from published sequences with high bootstrap support (95-
99%). Opisthorchis viverrini from the Philippines primarily grouped with the isolates from
Thailand and Vietnam in a well-supported clade (84%). The haplorchiids on the otherhand
clustered together in a single clade. This agrees with the reports on phylogenetic
relationships of heterophyid trematodes based on ITS2 sequences (Thaenkham et al. 2011).
However, Centrocestus formosanus, a close heterophyid relative of Haplorchis (Clausen
and Murrel, 2014), consistently grouped within Haplorchis taichui from Thailand with

strong bootstrap support (100%).

CHAPTER V

DISCUSSION

Mindanao has been identified as an endemic region for soil-transmitted helminths,
schistosomes, and food and water-borne trematodes. Among these, FBTs are considered to
be the neglected amongst neglected tropical diseases. There is a patchy distribution of fish-
bore parasites brought about by the nature of its transmission, as well as insufficient data
on some endemic regions. To further understand the transmission dynamics, prevalence,
and distribution of FBTs in the Philippines, this study attempted to determine the presence
of FBTs infecting humans and animals in Northeastern Mindanao. Furthermore, some
knowledge, attitude and practices of participants were investigated to infer possible factors
involved in transmission. Finally, the DNA isolated from heterophyid-like eggs in human
fecal samples were analyzed to confirm the species circulating in endemic regions in

Northeastern Mindanao, particularly in Caraga region.

The study found a relatively lower overall infection rate in humans compared with
surveys done in other areas in Mindanao (Belizario et al., 2004, 2022; Moendeg et al.,
2021). The conduct of the yearly mass drug administration (MDA) implemented by the
Department of Health (DOH) could play a role. However, it was observed that there were
pockets of endemicity with geographical distribution. Access to nearby fishing sites or

sources of fishes, and cultural practices such as consumption of infected fish predispose


communities in acquiring FBTs (Chai and Jung, 2017; Moendeg et al., 2021). A higher
prevalence was observed in Claver, Surigao del Norte. However, higher parasite intensity
is observed among participants in Esperanza, Agusan del Sur. Surigao del Norte appeared
to have higher odds of acquiring the infection possibly because of the source of fish foods.
It was observed that infection occurs in three municipalities in Surigao del Norte: Mainit,
Claver and Gigaquit, while no FBT infection was found in San Isidro, Surigao del Norte —
which is located on a separate island. Surigao del Norte is a fishery producing province. In
fact, Lake Mainit, which is the fourth largest lake in the Philippines and a valuable fishery
resource (Bifia-de Guzman et al., 2013), is situated in Surigao del Norte province.
Meanwhile, a high burden of fish-borne trematode infection was observed in Esperanza,
Agusan del Norte. Since only two individuals were highly infected with FBT eggs, it could
be due to inactive participation in deworming programs, or habitual consumption of raw or
inadequately cooked fish, as well as visit in other areas that are endemic with FBTs.
Furthermore, increased mobility and distribution of fishes sold outside the local community
(Keiser and Utzinger, 2005; Phan et al., 2011) could also contribute to the spread of
infection in non-endemic areas. There is also a wide range of marine and freshwater fish
hosts of these trematodes (Clausen and Murrel, 2014; Romero-Alvarez, 2020). Therefore,
the spatial distribution of these parasites will more likely increase. In addition, pickling or
salting the fish may cause possible infection in non-endemic areas because of exportation

of fishes.

In terms of sociodemographic factors, males and older individuals were found to have

higher infection rates than females and young individuals. Previous studies found that


social factors affect habits of eating raw fish. For instance, fishermen in Vietnam tend to
share and to enjoy raw fish together, which enabled the habit to pass from person to person,
as noted by Phan et al. (2011). He added that people enjoyed consuming raw fish with
alcohol as a way to socialize. Similarly, males in the Philippines prefer to eat kinilaw
together with alcoholic drinks as a form of relaxation (Moendeg et al., 2021). Meanwhile,
the lower prevalence in younger individuals could be associated with less preference of
children with raw foods, or that adults have a longer exposure of adults with the parasite,
such that there is a cumulative exposure of adults through consumption of raw or
undercooked fish. Araki et al. (2018) noted that consumption of raw fish among children
in Laos depends on the mother’s preference for raw fish dishes, but it is also possible that
the mother will prevent her child to eat raw fish if she thinks it will cause harm, thus

lowering the risk of acquiring FBT infection among children.

Households that own companion animals such as cats and dogs are also more likely to
get infected. Along with humans, cats and dogs are definitive hosts for the parasite. They
may acquire fish-borne parasites by also ingesting raw fish contaminated with the
metacercaria, and serve as important links for the continuity of the parasite life cycle
(Lahmar et al., 2017; Nissen et al., 2017). On a separate note, although animals were found
to be important reservoirs of infection, only two dogs were positive for microscopy. This
could be a result of low sensitivity of diagnosis, or low amount of fecal samples collected
during sample collection and thus, low parasite egg count. Nonetheless, environmental

contamination with animal feces containing eggs of FBTs increases the risk of infection in


the area, especially households that acquire their fish foods in nearby bodies of water such

as rivers and lakes (Moendeg et al., 2021).

On another note, results showed that consumption of raw fish dishes as an insignificant
risk factor of FBT infection. Possible reasons include emotional bias of some of the
respondents towards admitting that they practice raw food consumption (Nguyen et al.,
2020). Sanitary practices of how the dish was prepared such as the use of utensils could
also be an important factor aside from direct consumption of raw fish dishes. In countries
where eating raw or undercooked fish is unpopular such as in Iran, infection is assumed to
occur during gutting and scaling of the fish. The hands become contaminated with the
metacercaria and infection occurs via oral transmission (Teimoori et al., 2019). Cross-
contamination from using the same knife and chopping board for raw fish and other food

products in kitchens and in restaurants may also occur (Clausen and Murrel, 2014).

Intestinal worms did not rank highly in people's minds as an important health problem,
although very high proportions of respondents knew of the problem. Majority of the
participants know of food borne helminthiasis, but only a few identified eating raw food as
a source of infection. Some mentioned unrelated causative factors such as wearing of
protective footwear and close association with soil. Such sources of transmission are
related to SCH and STH infections, which have long been the prevailing parasitic diseases
in the provinces. Furthermore, although many perceive food bome helminthiasis as
potentially fatal, some still kept the habit of eating raw food because of insufficient or

wrong knowledge. Because of that, many people could underestimate its harmfulness and


show poor preventive measures. Evidently, most of the infected individuals from this study
were those with poor treatment seeking behaviors. On another note, even individuals that
participate actively in deworming programs can easily be reinfected with the parasite if
they will not adapt preventive measures, or if they continue to practice eating raw food.
These data can be useful in improving materials for information and education campaigns

as well as for the implementation of parasite intervention programs.

Detection and surveillance of FBTs remain a challenge in the Philippines. As pointed
by Tatonova (2017), ITS2 might be a suitable and sensitive marker for species-level
analysis. To some extent, use of ITS markers for screening/detection of FBT-positive fecal
samples were effective. However, detection of FBTs in this study showed limitations as
some species exhibit similar band size, and therefore cannot be used to discriminate some
species, particularly between intestinal and liver flukes. Although the determination of
diagnostic sensitivity between microscopy and ITS molecular detection is beyond the scope
of this study, the reported prevalence of trematode eggs in the human population reported
here may still be an underestimate considering that some samples were not successfully
amplified using the ITS marker. Aside from the number of eggs might have been too low
in some samples for DNA amplification to occur, or inhibitors in some fecal samples might
have also blocked amplification (Teimoori et al., 2019). Nonetheless, three FBT species
were successfully identified in this study and all of which have been previously reported
in the Philippines (Africa and Garcia, 1935; Belizario et al., 2004). Based on the sequenced

amplicons, the predominant parasite among the study sites is Haplorchis taichui, which is


also the most reported FBT in the country. Detection of seldomly reported FBTs such as
S. falcatus and O. viverrini suggests that these parasites still circulate and therefore pose
a health risk in the country. Presence of these parasites in poor areas connotes unceasing
burden which not only have direct consequences to health but also to economy, which
perpetuates the cycle of poverty. A more effective treatment (i.e. proper anthelminthic
dosage) is also needed especially for individuals infected with different species of FBT,
which is only possible through adapting a more accurate and species-specific diagnosis
such as PCR. Furthermore, sequencing of the ITS2 locus revealed high percent similarity
with the available sequences of FBTs isolated from fox, snail, cat, fish and humans from
Thailand, China, Vietnam, and Iran. The high percent similarities of H. taichui, O. viverrini
and S. falcatus from this study to the isolates from neighboring Asian countries may denote
a close association or spread of parasites through its hosts. Considering that the Philippines
houses popular tourist destinations and exports fishery products, spread of such parasites
is more likely to increase; thus, close attention should be given to these control points i.e.

food trade industry and food safety regulations and practices.

Overall, the struggle to eradicate FBTs and other intestinal parasites results from the
biosocial complexities of transmission and poor realization of its infection status as well as
distribution. Although molecular-based techniques can now be applied in diagnosis and
surveillance, the high cost and accessibility to facilities makes it unlikely to become a
standard tool for routine diagnosis especially in rural areas. Nonetheless, adapting site-
appropriate prevention and intervention strategies based on research is a step closer to the

control of these neglected diseases.

CONCULSION AND RECOMMENDATION

This study looked into the occurrence of fish-bore trematodes in some endemic rural
areas in Agusan del Sur and Surigao del Norte in Mindanao, Philippines. The presence of
FBTs was confirmed with an overall prevalence of 4.1%. Pockets of endemicity were
observed among the study sites, with relatively higher infection prevalence in Mainit and
Claver in Surigao del Norte. Although human fondness for raw or lightly prepared fish
foods remains a key determinant in acquiring heterophyid and other fish-borne trematode
infection, presence of other hosts in the environment as well as community perception and
thus, practices, also contribute in maintaining the infection. Furthermore, molecular
diagnosis revealed the following species: Haplorchis taichui, Stellanthchasmus falcatus,
and Opisthorchis viverrini. This is the first molecular identification of FBTs in the
Philippines. Further studies should consider these preliminary detections to clarify the

richness and abundance of trematodes.

Examination of local fish species that were identified to be eaten as raw or lightly
prepared, and snail intermediate hosts in the country need to be explored deeper to elucidate
transmission routes, which are essential in formulating possible preventive measures. In
terms of consumption of fish, studies on the viability of metacercaria in different food
preparation procedures such as salting or pickling, season of eating, and source of fish
would contribute to building sustainable preventive measures especially in communities
where eating raw fish is culturally-rooted. Use of data on risk factors are also valuable in

the development of education and public health campaigns regarding safe food practices


and access to improved sanitation. Furthermore, recovering adult worms from the study
areas is recommended to connect both morphological and molecular data for Philippine

isolates.

FBT is one of the neglected among the neglected tropical diseases. Infected
communities will continue to bear and possibly magnify the repercussions of the disease if
its presence remain unrecognized. Contrariwise, preempting such food borne infection is
workable with changes in the perception of what is delicious and safe to eat, as well as

proper sanitation involving both hosts and environment.
