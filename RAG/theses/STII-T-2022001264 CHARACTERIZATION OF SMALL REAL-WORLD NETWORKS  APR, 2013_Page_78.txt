ABSTRACT

We describe and model the structure of small-sized network systems involving
real-world data sets. Large systems, like the Internet and the World Wide Web,
often involving millions of nodes and cdges, has becn the most dominant data
sets in complex networks research. The finite size and sparse edge distributions
of small networks pose difficultics on extracting uscful cxpcrimental data because
of insufficient statistics. Several data sets of small real-world network systems -
influence and friendship networks; House of Representatives co-authorship net-
works; and MIDI music networks - are collected and analyzed. Known models for
each of the networks are simulated and network parameters for both small-sized
real-world networks and simulated model networks are compared.

Introduction

1.1 Networks as Graphs

The study on complex networks dates back to the problem of the Konigs-
berg bridge, shown in Figure 1.1, which asks ”can the seven bridges of the city
Konigsberg can all be traversed in a single trip without doubling back, given the
requirement that the trip ends in the same place it started”?

Figure 1.1: The seven bridges crossing the river Pregel in Konigsberg [1].

This problem was first addressed in graph theory and true enough, networks are
mathematically known as graphs. In its simplest form, a graph is a collection of
vertices that can be connected to each other by means of edges. In particular,
each edge of a graph joins exactly two vertices. Using a formal notation, a graph

is defined as follows.

Figure 1.2: An re of a formally-defined graph
[2]. The graph on = 1,..,10 with cdge sct E =
{{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {3, 5}, {3, o {4,5}, {5, 6}. {6,7}, {6, 8}, {6, 9}, {6, 10}, {9, 10}}

A graph G consists of a collection of vertices V and a collection of edges
E, for which we write G = (V, E). Each edge e € E is said to join two vertices,
which are called its end points. If e joins u, v € V, we write e = u, v. Vertex
u and v in this case are said to be adjacent. Edge e is said to be incident with
vertices u and v, respectively.

Another way to represent graphs is through an adjacency matrix. This
matrix, for a graph G with n vertices and m edges, comprises of n number of
rows and n number of columns with an entry Ali, j] denoting the number of edges
joining vertex v; and v,. To illustrate, an adjacency matrix for the graph in Figure
1.2 is shown in Equation (1.1).

The adjacency matrix shown above is symmctric and contains 1 and 0 valucs.

This is representative of an undirected and unweighted graph. The symmetry of
the adjacency matrix tells the directionality of the graph and the values tell the
weights of the cdgcs of the graph.

1.2 Network Parameters

Early researches in network science involve the structural analysis of real-world
systems which often entails the computation of properties that describes their
architecture. However. most of these systems are often very large that asymptotic
regularities cannot be observed by performing node-centric or local measurements
that are usually used in small networks. For these large systems, there is a need to
look into statistical measures that will show the global behavior of these network
properties [3].

1.2.1 Degree k

A network parameter commonly studied would be the number of edges con-
nected to a particular node. This is called the degree k; of a node i and one can
compute this locally or globally. For a network, the degree k; of an individual
node i is described as the number of edges incident on the node i. In terms of a

network’s adjacency matrix,

k= Do a5 (1.2)

where z is the weight of an edge and j runs over all the nodes j connected to
node i. This weight can have a value of z = 1 for unweighted networks and z > 1
depending on the weight conditions given to a weighted edge network.

This topological mcasurc has becn much cxamincd when it comes to char-
acterizing a network, particularly how the degree values are distributed over it.
The formula presented in Equation (1.2) is a local computation of the degrec.
However, a global value of 4: that describes the whole network may be obtained by
simply computing the average degree over all the nodes cxisting in the nctwork.

An example of a graph with node label as its degree is shown in Figure 1.4.

Figure 1.3: Graph with nodc labels as degrcc.

1.2.2 Radius R

There are other measures of interest which are related to the characterization
of the linear size of a network. We start by defining the shortest path length
0; as the minimum number of steps needed to reach node j from node i. The
eccentricity of a node i is defined by ec(i) = mazj;4i0;;, and the radius of a graph
G by radg = minjec(i).

1.2.8 Betwenness Centrality BC

One nctwork paramctcr that reveals nodcs that arc important in connccting
different parts of a network by acting as bridges is the measure of betweenness
centrality. This has been defined as the number of shortest path that passes on a
certain node i.

&= yo wl (1.3)

foretads
Equation (1.3) gives a formal mathematical definition of betweenness cen-
trality where o,; is the total number of shortest paths from h to j and op,;(i)
is the total number of shortest paths from h to j that pass through the node i.
An example of a graph with node label as its betweenness centrality is shown in
Figure 3.4.

Figure 1.4: Graph with node labels as betweenness centrality.

The computation for the betweenness centrality used in this study is based
on the algorithm proposed by Brandes in 2001 [? ].

1.2.4 Clustering Coefficient CC

The concept of clustering, first introduced in sociology [19], deals with the
characterization of nodes based on the structure of their local neighborhood. It is

defined as the degree to which nodes tend to cluster together.

__ 3x number of fully connected triples
~ number of triples
The clustering coefficient is defined in a variety of ways. One is by getting

cc

(14)

its global value given by equation (1.4) where a triplet consists of three nodes that
are connected by either two (open triplet) or three (closed triplet) undirected ties,
shown in Figure 1.5. A triangle consists of three closed triplets, one centered on
each of the nodes. The global clustering coefficient is the number of closed triplets
(or 3 x triangles) over the total number of triplets (both open and closed). An
example of a graph with node labels its clustering coefficient is shown in Figure
3.5.

The computation for the clustering coefficient used in this study is based
on the algorithm proposed by Saramki et. al. in 2007 [? ].

1.3. Research on Complex Networks

Our world is a collection of various systems that can be represented by networks
and, with this, the interest in the structure and evolution of networks [4, 5] has
madc its mark on the study of complex systems. Easily available data scts have
made this study widespread in the last few years.

Large real-world systems such as intcrnct topology, world-wide web, scicnce
collaboration networks, biological networks, and linguistic networks have been ex-
tensively studicd from a structural point of view [6-10]. Typically, these studics
address properties of the graph including its size, density, degree distributions,

average distance, small-world phenomenon, clustering coefficient, connected com-
ponents, community structures, etc. Large systems, like the Internet [6] and the
World Wide Web [11, 12], often involving millions of nodes and cdges have been
the most dominant data sets in complex networks research because small networks
often posc important concerns to be addressed. The finitencss of small networks
sets serious restrictions on extracting useful experimental data because of strong
size cffects and, often, insufficicnt statistics. Small networks were traditionally
studied from a node centric point of view where researchers wanted to answer
questions about behavior and properties of particular nodcs in the network. Al-
though such models are very expressive, they often fail to scale to large networks
with millions of nodes and edges. Moreover, a large network is needed for a struc-
tural property to emerge. In actuality, in the beggining of the 20th century. most
of the prominently studied networks have nodes and edges of at least the order of

10°, as seen in Table 1.1.

The ability to understand small real-world networks is inevitable because of
the numerous real-world systems that only involve a small number of components.
Studies on small systems can also help in further knowing the basic structures
of larger systems. These small systems are of interest in this study and we will
address them as ”small” networks.

This thesis is structured as follows. In Chapters II, III and IV, the three
small networks used in this research are - influence and friendship networks; House

of Representatives co-authorship networks; and MIDI music networks. The net-


works are constucted and the network parameters are computed for each them.
Chapter V discusses famous models of large complex networks that are imple-
mented to our small networks. Network parameters for both simulated and rcal
small networks are compared and analyzed.

Chapter 2

Influence and Social Networks

2.1 Introduction

Relationships are associations among people. These associations may be based
on different factors such as love, influence, authority, kinship and friendship. More-
over, relationships among can be modeled people as a network. People can be rep-
resented by nodes while the relations between people would act as the network's
edges, be it directed or undirected lines. One can further modify the network
by applying weights to the edges which would now correspond to the degree of
relationship between two persons. Such systems are known as social networks and
its study has an unquestionable place in in the field of complex networks [23, 24).
This part of the study focuses on relationships among college students; influence
and friendship relations in particular.

2.2 Network Construction

Four sets of surveys were conducted on a small group of students. The survey
was conducted from years 2008 to 2011 among male and female physics majors
belonging to the same year at the University of the Philippines in Diliman. The
surveys determine the most influential and friendliest people in the group. The
students were asked to rank (1-highest) 10 of their batch mates who has the most
influence on them and 10 of their batch mates who they consider their immediate
friends.

An undirected unweighted social network was made for each year. Nodes
represent students while edges represent the influence or friendship one student
has to the other. The number of nodes and the number of edges of each network
are shown in Table 2.1. The weight of the edges represent the degree of influence


or friendship one student has to another which have values that are inverse of the
value written in the survey (written in the survey: 1, 2, 3, ...:weight in network:
+, 3, 3), ...). This means that the higher the rank of influence and friendship to
a person, the stronger their edge weight. The resulting influence and friendship
networks are scen in Figure 2.1 and 2.2.

2.3. Network Characterization

2.3.1 Degree

The average degree for each influence and friendship network are also computed
as shown in Table 2.2 and 2.3 while the degree distribution of the networks were
computed and plotted in Figure 2.3 and 2.4. All networks for the influence and
friendship systems are observed to have a degree distribution that spreads over a
particular value of k, which appears to be near the average degree for the network.


This means that in all networks, there is a common value for the degree of each

node and that its neighboring nodes can have a degree near to the most common

valuc for k.

The degree distribution for each of the network follows a binomial distribu-
tion with shifting peaks around each network’s average degree for different years.
The average k of the influence and friendship networks both increase for the first
three years and a decrease is found in the fourth year. This is observed decrease is
attributed to the laboratory specialization acquired by the students during their
fourth years and also due to the decreasing number of nodes in the influence and
friendship networks.

2.3.2 Betweenness Centrality

Table 2.4 and 2.5 shows the average betweenness centrality for each influence
and fricndship netwoks. In Figure 2.5 and 2.6, the BC disrtribution is observed
for all influence and friendship networks. Betweenness centrality is the ability of
nodes to act as important bridges that connect components of a graph. It has been
found out that for the influece and friendship networks, a great number of nodes
have low betweenness centrality and that as the betweenness centrality increases,

there are lesser nodes in the network having that value.

This behavior of the values of BC for the nodes in the networks indicate
that the networks does not have a significant number of ” bridges” in the network
and that the networks does not have a significant number of isolated components.
Moreover, the average BC for the network decreases through time. This is due to
the decreasing number of students and their increasing interactions through time
give rise to this network structure. Despite students starting to have laboratory

affiliations on 2011, the networks does not show cliques or groups forming.

2.3.3 Clustering Coefficient

The averages of the clustering coefficient in each network are shown in Table
2.6 and 2.7. Moreover, the clustering coefficient dsitribution of a node for all the
influence and friendship networks are obtained and compared in Figure 2.7 and
2.8.

The CC distribution for all the networks follow a binomial distribution with
shifting peaks around the average clustering coefficient. Moreover, the average
clustering coefficient of the influence and friendship networks increased for the
first three years and this is due to the network structure having more edges as the

students in the system ercatc morc conncctions as time pass by.

House of Representatives
Co-Authorship Networks

3.1 Introduction

The availability and acccss to extensive databascs have made modclling prac-
tically all systems to complex networks possible. An example would be a co-
authorship or collaboration nctwork. Scvcral studics have been madc that have
used these types of networks. One of which is the network of scientific collabo-
ration which mapped the electronic database containing all relevant journals in

mathematics and neuro-science collaborations (8, 16, 18}.

3.2 Network Construction

Bills from the 8" to 14** Congress were downloaded from an on-line Philippine
legislative information system called LEGISontheweb (http://www.congress.gov.ph/legis/index
These were parsed and analyzed to construct co-authorship networks composed of
congressmen as nodes and co-authored bills as edges.
A bipartite graph is created with the first set of nodes corresponding to
the congressmen while the second set of nodes correspond to the bills written for
each congress. A connection is created from the bill to the congressman for every
authorship made. The bipartite graph is then converted into a network where the
set of nodes for the bills is removed and one is left with a network with nodes
as congressmen and cdges as co-authorship. An cxample of converting bipartite

graphs to networks is shown in Figure 3.1.


Figure 3.1: Converting bipartite graphs into networks.

Undirected edge-weighted versions of the network were made. Weights

represent the number of times two congressmen co-authored a bill. The network

sizes are shown in Table 3.1 and the house networks constructed are shown in

Figure 3.2.

centrality, degree and weights as shown in the legend located at the top of the

figure.

3.3. Network Characterization
3.3.1 Degree

The degree distribution for all the co-authorship networks for the House of
Representatives arc obtained and compared as shown in Figure 3.3 and the average
degree for each network is shown in Table 3.2. It is observed to have an increasing


degree distribution for higher values of k. This is a reflection of the co-authorship
network being a highly and fully-connected network with average k ranging from
185.157 tO 254.861.

3.3.2 Betweenness Centrality

Figure 3.4 shows the betweenness centrality distribution of the co-authorship
networks and Table 3.3 shows the computed avcrage BC for cach Congress. Most
of the nodes in the network appear to have very low betweenness centrality with
values ranging from 0-0.20. This distribution reflects the property of the co-
authorship network of being highly-connected. The tendency of nodes to act as


“bridges” that connects components of the network are very low because even if

random nodes in the network are taken out, it will still remain connected.

The distribution for betweenness centrality values for the 8°", 9**, 13", and
14‘ Congress is seen to have the most number of nodes to have the lowest values
for BC as seen with the presence of a peak in their BC plots. On the other hand,
the BC distribution for the 10%, 11%, and 12 Congress is seen to have equal
number of nodes having different BC values.


3.3.3 Clustering Coefficient

The clustering coefficient of the nodes in the network are also computed and
are compared for each congress, the CC distribution is shown in Figure 3.5 while
the average CC for each congress is shown in Table 3.4. It is observed that
all distributions appear to have high clustering coefficients with values ranging
from 0.75-1.00. This is inherent of their structure being densely connected. A
notable deviation would be in the 10“, 11, and 12 House of Representatives
co-authorship network because these networks do not have pronounced peaks and
most CC values observed for each Congress have equal number of nodes in the
network.

MIDI Music Networks

4.1 Introduction

With music companies now offering mp3 files on-line (e.g. iTunes with more
than 800,000 song tracks available) the rise of the amount of digital music readily
available in the Web has attracted many researchers to use this collectable data
for studies.

One area of this research would be on music style recognition with the
general idea of extracting features from songs. For the past several years, many
researchers have contributed work (25-27] in this field using different approaches.
One study described each piece as a graph, where the nodes are chords and the
directed edges connect chords which occur consecutively in the piece. Network
motif analysis is then applied to find recurring patterns in a piece (28). Another
study involved constructing networks where nodes and edges corresponding to mu-
sical notes and their co-occurring connections respectively. They analyzed works
from several composers by computing its network parameters and then tried to
replicate appcaling music [29].

Musical data is generally stored digitally and Musical Instrument Digital
Interface or MIDI, is one of the most common representations of music. MIDI
contains commands that allow communication between electronic musical instru-
ments, performance controllers, computers and other related devices [30]. The
MIDI protocol includes messages that relay events that instruct what should hap-
pen in a MIDI song. These events include NotcOn/NotcOff events, TimcClock,
Tuning Standard, Sample Dump Standard, File Dump, and many others [31]. For
example, when a sound ends, a NoteOff message is sent and executed. An example
of a simplified form of a MIDI file is seen in Table 4.1.


Table 4.1: Simplified sample of the contents of a MIDI file.

MIDI Event Time ak or ' wet. pe
NOTE ON t=45 | Track=0 | Picth=120 | Velocity = 4
NOTE OFF t=58 | Track=1 | Picth=12 | Velocity = 4
TIME SIGNATURE | t = 100 | Track = 0 - -

SET TEMPO t=130| Track =0 - -

4.2 Network Construction

MIDI songs were obtained from several websites from the intcrnct. Four data
sets have been prepared for this study. The first set are MIDI files from different
genres - Rock, Jazz and Classical music. They were choscn such that ten songs
belong to one musical composer. The collection included ten composers per genre.
The sccond data sct included songs from different genres - Country, Pop and Jazz
in a span of ten years. Most of the songs were chosen from the Billboards decade
end hit songs - 2000-2009. They were collected such that five songs bclong to onc
year.

A python program was created in order to convert the MIDI file to a text
file containing a series of MIDI events. The time events were converted to their
corresponding seconds equivalent.

An undirected and edge-weighted co-occurrence network for each track of
the MIDI file was constructed where the nodes of the network correspond to the
notes in the song. Simultaneous playing of two or more notes like a chord is
considered as one node. Edges are defined as connections from one note to another
chronologically and their weights correspond to the inverse of time the nodes were
played. This means that if two notes are played in a longer time apart, they will
have lower edge weights compared to two notes played with smaller times apart.
Suppose, in a piece of music, note i and note j start at time ¢; and ¢,, respectively,
where t; > t;. Then note j is said to co-occur with note i and a co-occurring edge
is defined from note i to note j with the value t; — t;. To make the undirected
network, an adjacency matrix was used, a matrix with rows and columns labeled
by graph vertices containing edge-weight value in position according to whether
nodes are adjacent or not. A flowchart of the construction of the music network

is found in Figure 4.1.


Figure 4.1: Flowchart of the MIDI analysis and an example of co-occurence net-
work construction.

Co-occurence networks are made for each instrument in a MIDI song. As
seen in Figure 4.2, different tracks used in the MIDI song Mean Mister Mustard
of The Beatles have different networks. Variations per instrument can be seen
because of the differences in the notes played of each instrument in a song and the
differences in the chronology the notes are played.

4.3. Characterization of Music Networks

4.3.1 Billboards Top 100

For the first data sct, a comparison was made over scvcral midi song from
Rock, Pop and Country music over a period of ten years 2000 to 2009. Figure
4.3 shows the diffcrent propertics observed from different music nctworks from
different genres. Although the network properties of Rock and Pop music does
not appcar to follow a trend over time, the radius of Country music was observed
to be higher than that of Rock and Pop music. This suggests that the network
structure of Country music is bigger and more complex than that of Rock and

Pop music.

4.3.2 Classical, Jazz and Rock Genres

The network parameters computed for the second data set are shown in Ta-
ble 4.2. The betweenness centrality of each music network for each genre was
computed. It was observed that Classical music networks arc found to have the
lowest betweenness centrality with a mean BC of 0.012+0.040. This was fol-
lowed by Jazz music networks with 0.027+0.063 and Rock music networks with


0.06340.114. Graphs with high betweenness centrality suggests that it contains
more nodes that acts as bridge that usually connect communities. This means
that Classical music networks have the densest music nctwork having more nodcs
and connections in its graph. This decreases the number of important bridges in
the network because the nodes are denscly connected to cach other. The mcan
radius is also computed and is found to be lowest in music networks under the
Rock genre with 3.387+0.712. This is followed with songs under the Jazz genre
with 5.718+2.164 and songs under the Classical genre 7.33143.146. These gives
information on the structural difference of the networks or songs belonging to
Rock, Jazz and Classical genre. Classical songs have large mean radius because
they make use of more unique notes and complex chords in greater variety and
are more complicated (as it may involve more than one theme and may appear in

more complex forms) than that of Jazz and Rock songs.

On the other hand, music networks under the Rock genre have higher
clustcring cocfficicnts, 0.310+0.067, comparcd to that of networks from Jazz,
0.302+0.0934 and Classical, 0.236+0.127, genres. This is in agreement with the
previous results for BC and R. Since Classical music networks have a larger set of
nodes and edges than Jazz and Rock networks, its CC, or the measure telling how
well clustered a network is, is expected to be smaller because of the disability to
cluster to farther nodes. For Rock genre, the high clustering may be due to the
fewer notes, fewer set of chords involved and more repeating chords in the chord

progressions.

Application of Network Models

5.1 Network Models
5.1.1 Erdos-Renyi Model: Random Networks

The systematic study of random graphs was initiated by Erds and Rnyi in 1959.
The term random graph refers to the disordered nature of the arrangement of
links between different nodes. In their article, Erds and Rnyi proposed a model to
generate random graphs with N nodes and K links. Starting with N disconnected
nodcs, random graphs are gencrated by connecting pairs of randomly sclectcd
nodes without edges yet. This process is done until the number of edges equals
K.

Characteristic to random networks is the appearance of a giant component
after reaching a certain threshold. When K small, the graph is likely to be frag-
mented into many small clusters of nodes and as K increases, the components
grow, at first by linking to isolated nodcs and later by coalescing with othcr com-
ponents. A transition occurs at K = N/2, where these small clusters form a single

giant component.


Figure 5.1: An example of a Erdos-Renyi graph with a giant component repre-
sented by red nodes|http://linbaba. files. wordpress.com/2010/10/erdos-renyi.png].

5.1.2 Watts-Strogatz Model: Small-World Networks

The famous notion ”six-degrees of separation” means that everyone can be
connected to any other person on the planet through a chain of acquaintances with
no more than five intermediaries. This was first proposed by Frigyes Karinthy
in 1929 in his play ”Chains”. This phenomenon is further cmprirically studicd
by Stanley Milgram in 1967. He called this the small-world phenomenon and
addressed the question: "Starting with any two pcoplc in the world, what is the
probability that they will know one another?”

Small-world networks arc systems that cxhibit the small-world bchavior.
For this configurations, the distances between the nodes of the network are small
and the diamcter scalcs as the logarithm of the nctwork size N. They also have
unusually high clustering coefficients compared to random graphs. One of the first
successful and interesting attempt in modelling small-world networks is proposed
by Watts and Strogatz [32] which makes use of a construction that allows con-
tinuous interpolation from a one-dimensional lattice topology, as seen in Figure
5.2.

Regular Smali-worid

p=0 erence > p=1
Increasing randomness

Figure 5.2: The random rewiring procedure of the WS model which interpolates
between a regular ring lattice and a random network without altering the number
of nodes or edges.

The model proposed by Watts and Strogatz start with a regular ring lattice
with N nodes. Each of the nodes in this lattice is connected to its immediate
neighbor. This will give a clustcring coefficient of zcro to the latticc. The edges
shall then be randomly rewired, with probability p, to randomly chosen nodes in
the lattice. Varving the probability of rewiring p is proportional to the randomncss
of the network. With values of p close to 0, the resulting network will be closer
to the original regular lattice while valucs closcr to 1 will yicld networks that arc
more similar to classic random graphs.

Most social networks are classified as small-world networks [33] and the
Watts-Strogatz model reflects social systems where most people are friends with
their immediate neighbors - neighbors on the same street, colleagues, people that
their friends introduce them to. Moreover, a common property of social networks
is that cliques form, representing circles of friends or acquaintances in which every

member knows every other member.

5.1.3 Barabasi-Albert Model: Scale-Free Networks

Several important large growing systems in Nature are observed to have degree
distributions that arc power-law in form in very large K. These networks arc
called scale-free networks because power-laws have the property of having the
same functional form at all scales comparcd to regular latticcs or random graphs

that have degree distributions that follows a binomial or Poisson.


Figure 5.3: An example of a scale-free network generated by the Barabasi-Albert
model through preferential attachment.

Barabasi and Albert [34] explained the power-law degree distribution in
complex real-world networks by introducing the idea of preferential attachment,
such that the likelihood of connecting to a node depends on the nodes degree.
Networks governed by preferential linking were found to have new edges that
preferentially attached to vertices with the high number of connections - ”the
rich gets richer” phenomenon. In the Barabasi-Albert model, a network shall be
constructed by starting with a small number of nodes. At every timestep, a ned
node mo is added with m( m0) edges that link to older nodes in the system.
By preferential attachment, the resulting probabilility that a new node willl be

connected to node i is

Tle)= 55 (62)

in which it depends on the degree k; of node i.

5.2 Application of Network Models to Real Small
Networks

5.2.1 Watts-Strogatz Model to Influence and Friendship
Networks

The Watts-Strogatz model was applied with varying rewiring probabilities to
our influence and friendship nctworks and the nctwork propcrtics observed were

compared in all cases. Simulations were done up to 50 trials with different rewiring


probability from p=0.1 to p=1. The distributions of the simulated network with
the highest correlation were obtained and plotted.

The degree distribution of the influence networks and the WS netwokrs for
different years are shown in Figure 5.4, 5.5, 5.6 and 5.7.

a binomial distribution with shifting peaks around the global average degree of

Figure 5.19: Bctweenness centrality distribution for the fricndship nctwork for

The betweenness centrality distribution of the real networks deviate from
the simulated Watts-Strogatz networks with correlation values ranging from 0.09
to 0.30. The clustering coefficient of the both the simulated and real networks
have very low values ranging from 0 to 0.15. However, the real networks follow a
power-law form while the simulated networks seem to have peaks at higher values
of BC. This can be explained by the real network's decreasing number of nodes
and its system retaining the same set of people. There is a possibility of values of


betweenness centrality to fall because of the people getting to know more of each
other across time making the network more connected.

We now observe the distribution of the clustcring cocfficient for all networks.
The distribution for the influence networks and the WS netwokrs are shown in
Figures 5.20, 5.21, 5.22 and 5.23 and the distribution for the fricndship networks
and its corresponding WS netwokrs are found in Figure 5.24, 5.25, 5.26 and 5.27.

For the clustering cocfficicnt, deviations have been observed between the
real networks against the simulated networks having correlation values ranging
from 0.3 to 0.7. The CC values of the simulated networks fall under the same
values of the CC values of the real influence and friendship networks. However,
the real networks have bigger spread compared to that of the simulated networks.
This can be attributed to the social system’s characteristics of retaining the same
set of people, the increasing interactions of these people, and the ”cliques” forming
through time. The network have more varieties of ”cliques” or formation of im-
mediate neighborhood compared to that of the ones generated by the WS models


thus making the CC distribution of the real networks spread wider compared to
its simulated Watts-Strogatz network.

5.2.2 Erdos-Renyi Model to House Co-authorship Networks

Figure 5.34: Degree distributions for the 14th Housc co-authorship network and
simulated ER networks with p = 0.975.

The degree distributions in the real networks reflect the authorship size of
a bill. It is observed that for both the simulated and real co-authorship networks,
the k values are seen to lie in the range of 150 to 270 because of the system’s high
number of authorship per bill. The real and simulated networks, however, have
correlation coefficients ranging from 0.1 to 0.6. The real networks have a wider
spread compared to the k values of the simulated ER networks. This is attributed
to the co-authorship network’s system of authorship being not entirely random.
There are more varying authorship sizes in the real network compared to that of

the simulated networks.


The betweenness centrality distribution were computed for the all the co-
authorship networks and the networks simulated from the Erdos-Renyi or ER
modcl.The comparisons are shown in Figure 5.35 to Figure 5.41.

The distribution of the betweenness centrality of a network reflect the num-
ber of bridges” that connect isolated clusters in a graph. The betweenness central-
ity distribution for all the network fall around 0.001 to 0.1, reflecting the network
structure’s dense connection. Although all the networks fall under this range,
deviations of the BC values for the real and simulated networks are seen having
correlation coefficients ranging from 0.09 to 0.3. This deviation is explained by the
network being densely connected making the nodes have very low BC values. The
real networks having wider spread compared to that of the simulated networks
imply that the co-authorship system of the House of Representatives have more
nodes that have differing values of betweenness centrality and that although the
real House of Representatives co-authorship network is densely connected, it still
has some number of nodes that connects certain subgraphs in the network.

The clustering coefficient of the nodes of the networks are also computed
and compared, as shown in Figure 5.42 to Figure 5.48. The distribution for real
networks appear to be concentrated on high values of the clustering coefficient
and while the distribution for the simulated networks also have high values for the
clustering coefficient, they appear to have isolated distribution of lower clustering

coefficient.

Comparison of the clustering coefficient of the real and simulated networks
yielded high correlation coefficients ranging from 0.08 to 0.2. Although both the
real co-authorship network and the ER network have CC values ranging from
0.9 to 1, representing the network structure’s dense connections, there are still
deviations with the spread of these values in the network. The real networks have
wider spread compared to that of the simulated networks due to the different
* configurations” of authorship groups that are found in the real system compared

to that of the random graph.

5.2.8 Erdos-Renyi Model, Barabasi-Albert, and Watts-Strogatz
to MIDI Music Networks

The Erdos-Renyi, Watts-Strogatz and the Barabasi-Albert model were used
to gencrate nctworks and compare its nctwork paramctcrs with that of the MIDI
music networks. Simulations were done up to 50 trials with different connecting
probability from p=0.1 to p=1 for the ER and the WS model. The distributions of
the simulated network with the highest correlation coefficient were obtained and
plotted. The cumulative degree distributions were obtained for all the music
networks - both real and simulated networks - and the comparison is shown in
Figure 5.49.

It is observed from the previous figure that the MIDI music network follow
the network generated by the Watts-Strogatz model or a small-world network.
The clustering coefficient of the MIDI music network, the WS network and a
randomized version of the music network was also obtained in order to support
the degree distribution similarity of the music network to the WS network. This

is shown in Figure 5.50.

One can note that the music networks have higher clustering coefficient


values compared to its randomized version. This is characteristic to a small-world

network generated by the Watts-Strogatz model.

Summary and Conclusions

Three sets of small real-world networks were used in this thesis - influence and
friendship networks; House of Representatives co-authorship networks; and MIDI
music networks. Network parameters were observed for structural analysis and
several network models were used in order to generate networks to compare with
the small real-world networks.

6.1 Influence and Friendship Networks

The average degree distribution of the influence and friendship gives informa-
tion on the sizes of groups in the social networks. The degree distribution of the
networks have peaks that represent the “clique” frequently found in the social
network. Interestingly, the average degree distribution increased over the years
except for the fourth year. This is due to the decreasing number of nodes of the
network and for their fourth year - the affiliation in a research laboratory.

Distributions of the betweenness centrality values were also computed and
is seen to follow a power-law form. This means that most nodes have low values
for BC reflecting the scarcity of ”bridges” that connect isolated clusters in the
network. This is because of the students behavior in increasing the interactions to
their fellow students through time making the network more connected. Moreover,
one of the results of this increasing interactions among students is the decrease of
the average BC over time.

The clustering coefficient distribution for each network was also obtained
and is seen to follow a binomial distribution with shifting peaks around the average
CC of the network. The average clustering coefficient of the network is also seen
to increase during the first three years but decrease during their fourth year.

The Watts-Strogatz simulated networks (with connecting probability p =


0.20.3) matched the influence and friendship networks degree distribution with
correlation coefficients ranging from 0.6 to 0.8. The betweenness centrality distri-
bution and the clustcring coefficient distribution, on the othcr hand, obtaincd low

correlation values ranging from 0.09 to 0.30 and 0.30 to 0.70, respectively.

6.2 House of Representatives Co-Authorship Net-
works

Network parameters computed for the House or Representatives co-authorship
networks represent features in its structure. Degree distributions computed for the
networks were seen to peaks that represent tha authorship size common to each
Congress. The betweenness centrality and the clustering coefficient were seen to
have very low and very high values, respectively. This is reflective of the system
being densely connected. Low values of betweenness centrality indicate that there
are very few nodes that connect isolated clusters and high values of clustering
coefficient indicate that almost all nodes have connected neighbor nodes. These
results reveal the structure of the co-authorship network being highly connected
with very few clusters.

The Erdos-Renyi model was used to generate networks, with connecting
probability p = 0.9—1.0 obtained low correlation values for the computed network
parameters. The degrce distributions obtaincd correlation coefficients ranging
from 0.1 to 0.6, the betweenness centrality obtained correlation coefficients ranging
from 0.09 to 0.3 while thc clustcring cocfficient distirbution obtaincd corrclation

coefficients ranging from 0.08 to 0.2.

6.3. MIDI Music Networks

Music network properties reflect the structure of the MIDI songs compiled.
Classical music makes use of a wide range of notes making it to have a larger
number of nodes and edges which may have resulted to high network radius and
low betweenness centrality. There are fewer nodes that act as bridges because
the network is densely connected. For the clustering coefficient, Classical music
has a bigger spread in the network so that nodes are far from others making its
clustering coefficient low. On the other hand, Rock music has a smaller network
and nodes can easily cluster by forming connections to its neighboring nodes.

The second data set is used to compute network properties to be compared


over time. Country music is observed to have a large radius over time compared
to Rock and Pop music suggesting that its network has consistently have more
number of nodes and cdges compared to that of Rock and Pop. This suggest
that Country music is a more complex network than Rock and Pop. The mean
betweenncss centrality, clustering cocfficient, and degree for all the music networks
has a temporal variation but no trend can be seen. This may suggest that the
structure of Classical, Rock and Pop music is constantly changing over timc.
Comparisons of the degree and clustering coefficient were made among the
MIDI music networks, Erdos-Renyi simulated networks, Watts-Strogatz simulated
networks and Barabasi-ALbert simulated networks. It has been seen that the
cumulative degree distribution of the MIDI music networks matched that of the
Watts-Strogatz network. Moreover, a computation of the clustering coefficient
distribution showed that the MIDI music network has higher clustering coefficient
compared to the network’s randomized version. Thus, making the MIDI music

network a small-world network.
