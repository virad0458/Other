ABSTRACT

Three rice varieties namely, Lian (NSIC Rc98), Tubigan 18 (NSIC Rc222), and Mabango 3
(NSIC Rc218) were combined with Camotes com grits. The gel consistency of the samples
ranged from 28 to 59 mm (hard to medium). On the other hand, the gelatinization temperature
for Mabango 3 was low (<70°C) and intermediate (70°- 74°C) for Tubigan 18, Lian, and
Camotes. Cooking water, cooking time, and height increase were directly proportional to the
amount of com. The water absorption index (WAI) and water solubility index (WSJ) increased
with greater amounts of com. Sensory evaluation results revealed that Lian-Camotes (90:10,
80:20,70:30), Tubigan 18-Camotes (90:10, 80:20,70:30), and Mabango 3-Camotes (90:10,
80:20,70:30) were the top nine most acceptable mixtures. Proximate compositions between raw
and cooked samples were not significantly different from each other. Minerals, essential amino
acids, phytochemicals, and antioxidant capacity significantly decreased after cooking. Starch and
amylose significantly increased after cooking. On the other hand, amylopectin decreased after
cooking. Correlation analysis also found that amylopectin has a strong positive correlation with
Estimated Glycemic Index (EGI). Based on CODEX Alimentarius, EAR (Estimated Average
Requirements), and RENI (Recommended Energy and Nutrient Intakes), rice and pigmented
com grits mix is a good source of protein, zinc, phosphorus, and energy and thus, can contribute to food and nutrition security.

CHAPTER 1

INTRODUCTION

Cereals, from the grass family Gramineae, are the most important food crops worldwide
that produce edible starchy pods or grains. These grains are often called ‘staples’ since they
provide more energy compared to any other crops. Cereals are the key sources of calories and
proteins for both humans and livestock. Rice and corn belong to the top most cultivated grains in
the world. (FAO, 1992; Sarwar et al.; 2013; Lafiandra et al., 2014).

Rice, being consumed as part of main meals by more than 50% of the world’s population
plays a significant role in food and nutrition security. Locally, cereals including rice contribute to
about 57.18% of daily total energy with an average of 1,469 kcal per day (FAO, 2013). Rice
prevails in many tropical countries such as the Philippines due to the warm, wet climate.
According to the US Department of Agriculture, Philippines was able to produce 18.97 million
metric tons of rice in 2014. Rice, usually consumed as boiled is a rich source of carbohydrates
and minute amounts of B-vitamins including niacin, riboflavin, and thiamin as well as minerals
like iron, phosphorus, potassium and sodium. It has a good digestibility and a low fat content
(TWBE, 1993).

According to Juliano (1993), the major eating quality factor of rice starch is amylose
content (AC). AC can be classified as low, intermediate, and high. At present, three popular rice

varieties of different amylose types are commercially available due to high acceptability among

farmers. These are NSIC Rc98 (Lian - high AC, 26.5%), NSIC Rc222 (Tubigan 18 -
intermediate AC, 24.0%), and NSIC Rc218 (Mabango 3 - low AC, 12.23%) (De Leon, 2911;
PhilRice SED, 2013).

Lian (NSIC Rc98) was first introduced to the market in 2001 by the National Seed
Industry Council (NSIC). It is a rainfed lowland variety that grows up to 116 days to a height of
98cm (RVIT, 2003). In a study conducted by PhilRice in Negros in 2012, this variety was among
thé five species that obtained high retums of investment based on the yield even during wet
seasons or at low amounts of fertilizers. On the other hand, Tubigan 18 (NSIC Rc222) is an
inbred variety released in 2009 by PhilRice is usually grown in inbred lowlands either dry or wet
seasons. It could yield up to 10 tons per hectare due to its moderate resistance to brown plant
hopper, green leaf hopper, and yellow steam borers. This variety matures up to 106 days when
direct-weeded and 114 days if transplanted (PhilRice, 2011). Moreover, Mabango 3 (NSIC
Rc218) is also included in the ten newly released varieties in 2012. It is among the top three
performing varieties across rainfed system. It is popular among farmers due to its high consumer
acceptability as an aromatic rice with an average yield of 3.8 tons per hectare (Laborte et al.,
2015).

Maize or com is the second most important agricultural product in the country. It also
supplements rice as a staple (Altoveros and Borromeo, 2007). Its production outyields wheat and
rice in terms of yield per hectare (FAO, 1992). According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, a
total of 2.21 million metric tons of corn was produced as of January 2016 (Simeon, 2016). Com
provides nutrients for both humans and animals and has been an important constituent of

industrial products like ceramics, explosives, industrial alcohols, medicines, vitamins, industrial

enzymes, construction materials, metal moulds, paint, paper goods, and textiles. It is also an
important component in several processed foods such as breakfast cereals, salad dressing,
margarine, syrup, flour, and other snack items (FAO, 1992; TWBE, 1993).

In 1908, the Office of Foreign Seed of the American Presbyterian Mission in Shanghai,
China discovered a “peculiar” kind of Indian corn. It was described as having several colors of
yellow, white, and red but of the same variety. Although the variety is small compared to other
varieties, it had the ability to withstand dry and hot winds. This variety was known to have
horny, starchy, or sweet endosperm. It has also been used as a main ingredient of porndges
(Collins, 1909). Indian com is one of the oldest com varieties and was first cultivated by the
Indians in Mexico. Nowadays, the term Indian com, however, is used as a general term for
multicolored varieties. Indian com varieties with kemels usually colored white, red, purple,
brown, or multicolored are disregarded as decorative materials during harvest and Halloween. It
is eaten after the ears have been removed and boiled or roasted. In developing countries, rice and
com are one of the cammon chief sources of energy in the diet (TWBE, 1993; ISI, 2014).

Today, a newly acquired pigmented com called ““Camotes” (CGUARD-N68) is available
at the Institute of Plant Breeding, University of the Philippines Los Bafios (IPB-UPLB). Camotes
corn originated from the Camotes Island, Cebu. Its color may vary from white, yellowish orange
to deep red. Maize, in general is an important food for large populations particularly in
developing countries. Previous studies have shown that com contains high amounts of protein
that lacks in rice (FAO, 1992). In addition, pigmented coms are known to possess anthocyanins,
caxotenoids, and phenolic compounds that have scavenging and bioactive properties (Chaudhary

et al., 2013).

Out of all maior nutritional problems, inadequate intake and unbalanced dietary intake as
a result of food and nutrition insecurity should be the focus of interventions. Chronic food
insecurity characterized by different forms of malnutrition such as deficiencies and imbalances
may be difficult to control (Latham, 1997). However, malnutrition is not only a problem in food
availability but also income and food and income distribution. Now, there is a rising market cost
of rice, a staple food for most developing countries due to the increase in the cost of production
due to problems such as diminishing profits, loss of available lands for production, aging
farmers, and many others (Papademetriou, 2000).

During the mid-1990s, those who were not able to buy expensive rice varieties such as
Milagrosa and Dinorado resorted to the rice imported by the National Food Authority (NFA).
However, it was noted that the NFA rice is “not fit for people to eat” due to its inferior sensory
qualities. In the Philippines, com is generally cheaper than rice. It is consumed in significant
amounts in Visayas and Mindanao. These areas that mostly consume other cereal products aside
from rice also have high incidences of poverty (Aguilar, 2005). Thus, with the increasing market
cost of rice, a more practical option is to mix it with com gnits.

The general objective of the study was to evaluate rice and pigmented com grits mix as a
staple. Specifically, the study aimed to:

1. assess the physicochemical properties (gei consistency and gelatinization temperature)
and cooking parameters (cooking water, cooking time, height increase, water absorption
and solubility indices) of rice and pigmented corn grits mixtures;

2. determine the sensory characteristics and acceptability of cooked rice and pigmented com

grits mixtures;

3. measure the nutritional and non-nutritional components of the top nine most acceptable
rice and pigmented com grits mixtures;
3.1. proximate composition (moisture, crude fat, crude protein, crude fiber, total ash,

carbohydrate)

3.2. carbohydrate profile (starch, amylose, amylopectin)
3.3. minerals (calcium, iron, zinc, phosphorus)
3.4. essential amino acids (lysine, tryptophan)
3.5. phytochemicals (anthocyanidins, flavonoids, total phenols, beta-carotene)
3.6. antioxidant capacity

4. measure the in-vitro glycemic index of the tcp nine most acceptable rice and pigmented
com grits mixtures;

5. determine associations between gel consistency and cooking parameters, phytochemicals
and antioxidant capacity, and carbohydrate profile and estimated glycemic index; and

6. determine the percent nutrient contribution per day of the top nine most acceptable

cooked rice arid pigmented corn grits mixtures.

The study was conducted at the Institute of Human Nutrition and Food, University of the
Philippines Los Bafios, College, Laguna from August 2016 to June 2017. The rice varieties used
in the study were of interest due to their commercial availability and high acceptability among
farmers (De Leon, 2011; PhilRice SED, 2013). Camotes, on the other hand, is a newly acquired
pigmented com from IPB-UPLB. Phytochemical compounds in pigmented com, according to

studies, have antioxidant, antimutagenic, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties that are

relevant to the increasing rates of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and chronic lung
diseases worldwide (WHO, 2015).

Laboratory analyses namely, proximate composition (moisture, crude fat, crude protein,
crude fiber, total ash, nitrogen free extract), carbohydrate profile (starch, amylose, amylopectin),
minerals (calcium, iron, phosphorus, zinc), essential amino acids (lysine, tryptophan),
phytochemicals (anthocyanidins, flavonoids, total phenols, beta-carotene), antioxidant capacity,

and in-vitro glycemic index were performed for rice and pigmented com grits mixtures.

CHAPTER 2

REVIEW OF LITERATURE

Rice (Oryza sativa L.)

Morphology

» An outer covering composed of the hull and caryopsis or fruit protects the rice grain. The
unpolished caryopsis is called brown rice. The caryopsis encompasses the embryo and the
starchy endosperm that is covered by the seed coat (tegmen) and the pericarp (Juliano and
Bechtel, 1985) as shown in Figure 1. The embryo is the rudimentary plant tissue that develops
into the rice plant during germination. The largest portion of the embryo is the scutellum
(cotyledon) that appears to shield the coleoptile and coleorhiza (Smith and Dilday, 2003). The
endosperm cells are thin-walled and packed with amyloplasts containing compound starch
granules. The endosperm contains the aleurone layer and subaleurone layer that are rich in
protein and lipid (del Rosario et al., 1968). Tegmen (seed coat) is a thin membrane with broken
cell walls, which is a remnant of the inner integument of the ovary. The pericarp, on the other
hand, is the mature ripened ovary wall that transports solutes and minerals to the developing seed
during ripening. The associated structures such as lemma, palea, and rachilla form the rice husk

or bull. Aleurone, tegmen, pericarp, and embryo constitute the rice bran. The main objective of

milling is to remove the husk and the bran layers from paddy rice to produce whole white rice
kemels that are sufficiently milled, free from contaminants, and contain a minimum number of

broken kernels (Chang and Bardenas, 1965; Smith and Dilday, 2003; IRRI, n.d.).

Milling degree

Milled rice may be further classified into three — undermilled, well-milled. and extra-
well-milied. Undermilled rice, usually known as the brown rice is obtained by milling husked
rice but not to the degree necessary to meet the requirements of well-milled rice. Well-milled

rice or white rice is obtained by milling husked rice in such a way that some of the germ and all


the extemal layers and most of the internal layers of the bran have been removed. Extra-well-
milled rice, on the other hand, is obtained by milling husked rice that almost the entire germ,

extra layers, and the largest part of the intemal layers of the bran and some of the endosperm has

been removed (CAC, 1995).

Classification

According to CODEX Alimentarius Commission (1995), rice grains can be classified in
three specifications — kemel length/width ratio, kernel length, or combination of kemel length
and the length/width ratio as seen in Table 1. Rice traders are required to indicate which

classification is chosen.

more than 6.0 mm and a length/width ratio of less than 3.

1.3 Short grain rice has a kemel length of 5.2 mm or less and a
length/width ratio of less than 2.



Composition and Nutritive Value

The rice bran has the highest energy and protein content in contrast to the hull. Abrasive
or friction milling to.remove the pericarp, seed coat, testa, aleurone layer, and embryo causes
nutrient loss particularly, fat, protein, crude and neutral detergent fiber, ash, thiamine, riboflavin,
niacin, and alpha-tocopherol. Therefore, dietary fiber and B-vitamins, alpha-tocopherol are also
more evident in brown rice than milled or white rice. Contrastingly, available carbohydrates, and
starch are higher in milled or white rice than brown rice. The rice grain also does not contain

vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin C (FAO, 1992).

Health Benefits

Milled rice is not just a good source of energy but it can also help regulate and improve
bowel movements and stabilize blood sugar levels. It is aiso beneficial in slowing down the
aging process since it is an essential source of vitamin B1 (thiamin). Phenolic compounds such
as tocopherols and gamma-oryzanoly! in rice have been known to contain antioxidants. Colored
Tice varieties have also been noted to possess high scavenging activities against cancer and
prevent oxidative stress, cardiovascular disorders, and diabetes mellitus. In addition, the lysine
content of milled rice is considered one of the highest among cereal proteins at 3.5 to four

percent (Shekhar et al., 2016).


Pigmented Corn (Zea mays L.)

Morphology

The maize plant may be envisioned as a system composed of processes such as
photosynthesis, root absorption, and metabolism with starch as the main product deposited in
organs called kernels. In botany, maize kemels are known as caryopsis where a single grain
contains the seed. Figure 2 shows the four main structures of the maize kemel include the
pencarp (also hull or bran), germ or embryo, endosperm, and the tip cap (dead tissue found
where the kernels join the cob). These morphological characteristics may evolve through time
because of natural selection and domestication. In addition, exposure to changing environmental
conditions may also affect their genetic characteristics. Maize grains develop in the ears or cobs
with each containing about 300 to 1000 kemels in a variable number of rows, usually 12 to 16.
Upon harvesting, maize ears are removed from the plant either manually or mechanically. The

husks covering the ears are stripped off following the separation of kemels (FAO, 1992).

Figure 2. Longitudinal section of a maize kemel (adapted from FAO, 1992).

Types

Com varieties can be classified into five types based on the type of endosperm. Pop com
has a very thick pericarp with a hard endosperm texture. Its crown appears to be pointed or
rounded and is usually grown for confectionery. Flint varieties have thick medium pericarp with
rounded crown. It is mostly hard in endosperm texture and is often used for a variety of uses.
Dent cor has either hard and soft endosperm texture with a dented crown and medium type of
pericarp. It is mostly used as livestock feed, industrial processes or millground meal. Floury

maize is a grain with a soft endosperm and is usually cultivated for a variety of products for


human consumption such as flour and parched beverages. Its pericarp is stretched thin and a
slighty dented crown. Sweet com, on the other hand, has a thick medium pericarp and a glassy
endosperm. Its crown appears to be wrinkled and is mostly canned, used for beverages, or

consumed at the milk stage (Mejia, 2003).

Composition and Nutritive Value

The seed coat or pericarp contains high crude fiber content of about 87 percent
comprising of hemicellulose (67%), cellulose (23%), and lignin (0.1%) (Burge and Duensing,
1989). The endosperm has high levels of starch at 87.6 percent, protein content of about eight
percent, and relatively low crude fat levels. The germ has a high crude fat content (33%) and
protein (18.4%). The aleurone layer, on the other hand, contains high protein levels (19%) and
crude fiber. The germ contains few amounts of some essential amino acids, lysine and
tryptophan. The endosperm has the highest nitrogen content, however, it is low in lysine and
tryptophan. Protein is mostly concentrated in the endosperm. Consequently, germ oil contains
relatively high levels of fatty acids (Bressani and Mertz, 1958; Bressani et al., 1990; Weber,

1987; FAO, 1992).

Health Benefits

A pigmented com from Peru is believed to be cultivated way before the Inca civilization.
This com variety has been found to contain anthocyanins and phenolic compounds that have
functional properties against colon cancer (Moos, 2014). Compared to other cereals like wheat,
oat, and rice, maize has a higher antioxidant capacity. Table 2 shows the total phenolic and

anthocvanin contents in different maize varieties (Chaudhary et a/., 2013).

In a similar study by Pascual-Teresa et al. (2002), six anthocyanins were isolated in

purple com cob using semipreparative HPLC and identified using LC-MS hydrolytic techniques.

b— expressed as cyanidin 3-glucoside
d- Lopez-Martinez et al. (2009)


These anthocyanins include cyanidin-3-glucoidase, pelargonidin-3-glucosidase, peonidin-3-
glucosidase, and respective malonyl derivatives. These have been found to be vaso-protective,
anti-inflammatory, and effective as a treatment for blood circulation disorders (Pedreschi and
Cisneros-Zevallos, 2005). Moreover, phenolic compounds from purple comncob were reported to
possess antioxidant, antimutagenic, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties. The anti-
inflammatory effect of these compounds have a great potential in controlling obesity and
hypertension, prevention of coronary heart disease and vision loss, and decreasing the risk of
cancer development (Monroy et al., 2016). The compound cyanidin-3-glucoside-rich purple corn
color (PCC) in purple com prevents obesity in high fat diet-fed mice. Specifically, this
anthocyanin reduced weight gain, and white and brown adipose tissue accumulation in mice. In
addition, high fat diet induced hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia in
combination with PCC normalized the insulin, fatty acid, and triacylglycerol levels. Thus, based
on the biochemical and nutritional analyses of the study, the use of PCC or anthocyanins as a
functional food may benefit the obese and the diabetic (Tsuda et al., 2003).

In a study by Utrilla-Coello ef al. (2011), corm meal from blue com, a variety of
pigmented corn obtained the highest protein content among other types of experimental flours
used in the study. The blue com variety has been widely used in ‘atole’, tortillas, corn chips,
muffin mixes, com flakes and others. In a research by the New Mexico Cooperative Extension
Service, it was found out that blue com contains higher amounts of lysine than white and yellow
varieties used in tortillas. In addition, it was also discovered to have high amounts of iron and

zinc (Dickerson, 2003).


Starch

Starch is the most important and abundant digestible complex carbohydrate in cereal
grains particularly, rice and com. Milled rice is made up of about 90% starch. On the other hand,
starch contributes to up to 72 to 73% in maize kemels It is mostly stored in the leaf, stem (pith),
root (tuber), seed, fruit, and pollen of plants. Starch is a homopolysaccharide comprised of
glucose units and two polymers, amylose and amylopectin whose glucopyranosyl units are
connected through a-(1-4)-glucosidic bonds. Amylose is linear in form. Amylopectin, on the
other hand, is branched in structure and whose units are linked through a-(1-6)-linkages.

Starch is not water-soluble but it easily hydrates in aqueous solutions, causing granules to
swell. An increase in temperature such as cooking takes the swelling further until a temperature
of disorganization is reached called gelatinization temperature. Continuous heating results to
pasting where amylose and amylopectin portions leach producing a viscous suspension. Upon
cooling of the suspension, gel starts to form where realignment of amylose and amylopectin
occurs in a process called retrodegradation Retrodegradation can lead to syneresis where water
starts to seep. It usually occurs more rapidly in amylose and relatively slower and incomplete in
amylopectin because of its short and branched chains (Juliano, 1993; FAO, 1998). Table 3 shows

the properties of rice and com starches.

Glycemic Index

GI is referred to as the incremental area under the glucose response curve after a standard
amount of carbohydrate from a test food relative to that of a control food (i.e. white bread or
glucose) is consumed (Wolever, 1991; FAO, 1998; Ludwig, 2002). It assigns a numeric score to
a food based on the rate of blood sugar rise. Foods are ranked on a scale of 0 to 100, with pure
glucose (sugar) given a value of 100. Low GI foods release glucose slowly and steadily.
Conversely, high GI foods release glucose rapidly. Low GI foods tend promote weight loss,
while foods high on the GI provide energy more readily (Harvard Medical School, 2015).

Based on the data provided by FNRI (2013), majority of the local rice varieties have
either medium or high glycemic indices. Felix et al. (2013) studied seven kinds of milled rice
with different types of apparent amylose to test if there are associations between AC and
glycemic index (GI) including AC and level of satiety. The GI of a food implies its ability to
release glucose in the bloodstream for a specific length of time. Ludwig (2000) states that low

Gl-foods contribute to satiety. Results revealed an inverse relationship between AC and GI


among the non-waxy rice varieties but due to variations in satiety, more researches with longer
feeding period must be conducted to strongly prove the association between AC and satiety
(Felix et al., 2013). Low GI, high AC rice such as brown rice has better satiety index as it is

digested slower compared to the conventional white rice (Juliano, 2013).

Physicochemical Properties

Apparent gel consistency and gelatinization temperature were tested using the methods of
the Rice Technical Working Group (RTWG) (2000) in Appendix B. Gel consistency refers to the
measurement by length in a test tube of a cold gel held horizontally for 30 minutes to an hour
(Cagampang ef al., 1973). Samples were classified based on length: hard (25-40mm), medium

(41-60mm), soft (61-100mm).


Gelatinization temperature refers to the temperature grain turns into gel as determined by
the Alkali Spreading Value (RTWG, 2000). Six whole grains were spread evenly in a 60mm x
15mm transparent culture dish. Dishes were covered and left undisturbed for 23 hours at room
temperature and rated visually using a 7-point scale as described by the Alkali Spreading Value

(ASV).

Cooking Parameters

The optimum cooking parameters (Appendix C) such as cooking water, cooking time,
and height increase were determined following the procedures of RTWG (2000). Automatic rice
cookers were used to cook the grains. The height of the cooked rice at three points was measured
using a steel tape. The exact cooking time was recorded in minutes and in seconds using a
stopwatch.

Water absorption and solubility were determined after the procedures of Anderson as
cited by Escobar (1992). Water Absorption Index (WAI) refers to the weight of gel per gram of
dry sample. On the other hand, Water Solubility Index (WSI) refers to the amount of dry solids
recovered from WAI sample. WAI was calculated as the weight of gel per gram of dry sample

and WS] as the amount of dried solids recovered fro1.1 WAI test.


Sensory Evaluation

Sample Size and Sampling Design

Among the fourteen barangays in the municipality of Los Bafios, Barangay Mayondon
has the highest number of population composed on 4,253 households. This is according to the
Barangay Integrated Development Plan for 2016. For the sampling procedures to be statistically
acceptable, a sample size (n) of 134 was obtained by using the Simple Random Sampling
technique where a margin of error, P=0.07 and a confidence level of 90% were used. The
number of participants study was reduced to 50% with a sample size (n) of 67 for the preliminary
study. Cost and time constraints were considered using these conditions. Mothers were randomly
selected from the list of barangay households. Since the scope of the survey is only concentrated
in one barangay in the municipality of Los Bafios, it is not a representative of the whole

Philippine population.

Ethics Approval

An ethics approval for the conduct of the sensory evaluation was obtained from the
University of San Agustin Research Ethics Review Committee (USA-RERC) (Appendix D).
Before conducting the sensory evaluation, the background, objectives, and data gathering
procedure of the study including its possible risks and benefits, participation criteria, privacy,

and confidentiality of results were discussed among the participants. An informed consent


(Appendix E) containing all the necessary information were provided and signed by the
participants. They were provided with bottled water and instructed to rinse their mouths before
and after tasting each sample. General acceptability as well as sensory parameters including
color, aroma, cohesiveness, flavor, and tendemess were determined using the nine-point hedonic
scale (Appendix F). A pilot sensory evaluation of 31 samples among 67 randomly selected
participants was conducted to determine the top nine most acceptable cooked rice and pigmented
com grits mixtures. On the other hand, a second sensory evaluation of the top nine most

acceptable cooked rice and pigmented com grits mixtures was conducted among 134 randomly

selected participants.

Data Gathering Procedure

Gatchalian (1989) suggests that the best time of the day for sensory evaluation is two
hours before or after a meal with a maximum of five to six samples per evaluation period.
Therefore, the sensory evaluation was conducted between the following hours: 9:00 to 10:00 in
the moming and 3:00 to 4:00 in the afternoon. Participants who do not have any allergies to rice
or com and of legal age were randomly chosen to participate in the study. Mothers who were not
fit to participate due to certain conditions such as having colds, cough or any illnesses during the
activity were excluded from the study. Before the sensory evaluation, each participant was asked
to read and agree with the terms of the informed decision. Names were replaced with special

codes that identify each participant.


Chemical Analyses

Proximate Composition

Moisture, also called water, refers to the amount of free water and volatile substances that
are lost by drying the food under controlled conditions in a vacuum or air oven (AOAC, 1980;
FNRI-DOST, 1997) (Appendix G). Oven drying method was used to determine the moisture
content. The percent moisture content was calculated using the equation below:

% moisture = weight of water x 100
weight of sample

Crude fat refers to the estimated total fat content of a food item including true fats and
various lipid substances such as fatty acids, lecithin, and pigments extracted by Soxhlet method
using ether as solvent (AOAC, 1980; FNRI-DOST, 1997). It is an estimation of the oil content
and other pigments that are removed by organic solvents. Crude fat was measured using the
Soxhlet method (Appendix G). The following formula was used to calculate the amount of fat.

% crude fat = weight of fat x 100
weight of sample

Total nitrogen was determined using nitrogen analysis by colorimetry of Nkonge and
Balance (1982) (Appendix G). Fifty mg of dry, defatted, ground sample was placed in a 30 ml
digestion flask. Crude protein was then calculated using the formula:

% nitrogen = weight of nitrogen x 100
weight of sample


Nitrogen was converted to protein using the formula, % protein = % nitrogen x 6.25. On
the other hand, carbohydrate (expressed as nitrogen free extract, NFE) was computed using the

formula:
% NFE = 100 — (% Moisture + % Crude Protein + % Ash + % Fiber + % Fat)

Crude fiber is the fraction of the sample that is not removed wither by acid or base
hydrolysis. It was determined following the procedures of AOAC (1980) (Appendix G). [t is
used as an index to determine the amount of the indigestible matter and approximates the amount
of the dietary fibers present in food. The formula below shows how the crude fiber content was

computed.

% crude fiber = weight of fiber x 100
weight of sample

Total ash represents the mineral content of a sample. One hundred mg defatted, dry,
ground samples were placed in a tared 30 mL porcelain crucible to be placed in the oven for
ignition (Appendix H). The following formula was used to measure the total ash content.

% ash = weight of ash x 100
weight of sample

Carbohydrate Profile

Starch by anthrone method (Appendix H) was done following the procedures of
Shallenberger et al. (1975). The line equation was used to calculate for the starch contents of the

samples:


% glucose = weight of glucose x 100
weight of sample

Glucose was converted to starch using the formula, % starch = % glucose x 0.90.

Amylose was analyzed according to Williams ef al. (1958) (Appendix H). Amylose
content is being used as an index in the gene incorporation program of waxy com with other
genotypes to improve resistance against downy mildew. The total amylose content was measured
using the formula:

% amylose = weight of amylose x 100
weight of sample

Amylopectin, on the other hand, was determined by subtracting the value of amylose

from total starch.

Minerals

Calcium analysis (Appendix I) was done following the procedures of AOAC (1980).
Samples subjected to analysis were titrated with EDTA until a true color is obtained. The amount
of calcium was calculated by:

%calcium in sample = (mL EDTA) x 0.025 x (40.2) x (50/5) x (100/1000)
% Ca=(mL EDTA) x 0.050

where:
(40/2) = equivalent weight Ca
0.025 = normality of EDTA
(50/5) = aliquot of sample


Iron analysis (Appendix I) was done after the procedures of AOAC (1980). After mixing,
the solution was allowed to stand for one hour and the absorbance was read at 520 nm using a
spectrophotometer. Iron content was calculated by:
% iron =. weight of iron x 100
weight of sample
Zinc analysis (Appendix I) was done according to the procedures of Platte er al (1959)
and Valdman et al. (2007). The absorbance of the solution was measured at 620 nm. The
following formula was used to calculate for the amount of zinc in sample:
% zinc = weight of zinc x 100
weight of sample
Phosphorus analysis (Appendix I) was done according to the procedures of AOAC
(1980). The percent transmittance was read at 470 nm. The following formula was used to
calculate for phosphorus in the sample:

% phosphorus =___weight of phosphorus __ x 100
weight of sample

Essential Amino Acids

Lysine and tryptophan are indispensable amino acids or those that cannot be synthesized
by the body that are needed for growth and development. Lysine analysis was determined using
the procedure of Tsai et al. (1972) (Appendix J). The absorbance was read at 390 nm. Lysine

was calculated using the formula:


% lysine =__weight of lysine __ x 100

weight of sample

Tryptophan analysis (Appendix J) was adapted from the procedure of Opienska-Blauth et

al. (1963). Absorbance was measured at 545 nm. Tryptophan was calculated using the equation:

% tryptophan =__weight of tryptophan __ x 100
weight of sample

Phytochemicals

Anthocyanidin (Appendix K) analysis was based on the method of AOAC (1980).
Anthocyanidins are part of a general class of chemical elements called flavonoids or
bioflavonoids. Absorbance was read at 700 nm. The following equation was used to calculate for
anthocyanidin:

% anthocyanidin =__weight of anthocyanidin _ x 100
weight of sample

Flavonoid content (Appendix K) was analyzed using the method of The Tea Association
of America (2000). Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds that are ubiquitous in nature and are
categorized, according to chemical structure, into flavonols, flavones, flavonones, isoflavones,
catechins, anthocyanidins and chalcones. The absorbance was read at 710 nm. The total
flavonoid content was measured using the formula:

% flavonoid =__weight of flavonoid _ x 100
weight of sample


Total phenols (Appendix K) were measured using the procedure of AOAC (1980).
Phenols or phenolics are a large group of naturally occurring organic compound found in plants
and is responsible for several chemical reactions observed in the plant material. Absorbance was
read at 710 nm. The following calculation was used:

% phenols =__weight of phenols _ x 100
weight of sample

Beta-carotene (Appendix K) was determined following the procedure of AOAC (1980).
Absorbance was read at 436 nm. The following equation was used:

% beta-carotene =__weight of beta-carotene_ x 100
weight of sample

Antioxidant Capacity

Antioxidants are substances or nutrients in our foods that can prevent or slow the
oxidative damage to our body. When our body cells use oxygen, they naturally produce free
radicals (by-products), which can cause damage. Antioxidants act as “free radical scavengers”
and hence prevent and repair damage done by these free radicals. Health problems such as heart
disease, macular degeneration, diabetes, and cancer are all contributed by oxidative damage.
Antioxidants may also enhance immune defense and therefore lower the risk of cancer and
infection. Analysis of antioxidant capacity (Appendix L) was conducted using the procedure of
Shimada ef al. (1992). The lower the absorbance at 517 nm represented the higher DPPH
scavenging activity. The following calculation was usd:

% DPPH scavenging activity = [1- (test sample absorbance/blank sample absorbance)] *

Glycemic Index

D-glucose in plant extracts usually occurs together with maltose maltosaccharides, starch,
sucrose, and/or B-linked glucose oligosaccharides. The glucose oxidase/peroxidase (GOPOD) kit
can be used for the specific measurement of D-glucose in extracts of plant materials or foods.
The color that forms is stable at room temperature for at least two hours after development
(Megazyme, 2005). The estimated glycemic index (EGI) was calculated using the equation in

Appendix M. The reactions involved were

D-Glucose + ©, + H,O (glucose oxidase) gluconate + H,O,

2.H,O, + p-hydroxybenzoic acid + 4-aminoantipyrine
(peroxidase)

quinoneimine dye + 4 H,O

Statistical Analysis

Stata Statistical Software 2013 by StataCorp LP in College Station, Texas was used.
Results of the sensory evaluation were analyzed using non-parametric one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) (Lim, 2011). Data gathered from the physicochemical anaiyses were
evaluated using two-way ANOVA to consider the effects of variety and mixture. Chemical
analyses were examined using three-way ANOVA to account for the effects of variety, mixture,
ana cooking (Stoline, 1981). Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) post hoc test was
used to locate significant differences between mean values (Abdi and Williams, 2010). All tests
were performed using five percent level of significance and 95% confidence level. Pearson

Correlation was used to determine associations between analyses (Lund Research Ltd., 2013).

CHAPTER 4

RESULTS AND DICUSSION

Physicochemical Properties

Gel Consistency

Gel consistency was developed as an indirect method for screening the rice hardness of
cooked rice especially in high amylose rice types (Cagampang et a/., 1973). Rice samples may
be classified as soft (61-100 mm), medium (41-60 mm), and hard (25-40 mm) (Juliano, 1985;
Tran et al., 2011; Chemutal e¢ al., 2016). Gel was measured by length in the test tube where cold
gel was held horizontally for one hour.

The gel consistency of the samples ranged from 28 to 59 mm. Results reveal that there
was a significant difference between rice type and mixture. Out of the pure samples, Mabango 3
obtained the longest gel measurement of 59 mm. This was followed by Tubigan 18 (49 mm),
Lian (43 mm), and Camotes (28 mm). It can also be observed that there is a direct relationship
between the amount of com and texture wherein, as the amount of com increases, the gel length
decreases; therefore, the harder the gel consistency. In addition, the higher the amylose content,
the harder gel consistency which may result to a longer cooking time as seen in Table 5. A hard

gel consistency was caused by the formation of rigid gels during cooking. Amylose polymers of


starch leach when the granules were heated. Upon cooling, networks start to form causing the
granules to harden (Nguyen ef al., 1998; Lii and Tsai, 2000). Thus, Lian-Camotes mixtures took
a longer time to cook compared to Tubigan 18-Camotes and Mabango 3-Camotes mixtures as

seen in Table 8.

Gelatinization Temperature

Gelatinization, in general, refers to the irreversible loss of the crystalline regions in starch
granules that occur upon heating in the presence of water (FAO, 1998). Gelatinization

temperature of starch refers to the cooking temperature wherein least 90 percent of the starch


granules have gelatinized or lost birefringence (Little ef a/., 1958). It is dependent on the water
content and starch content and is determined by the alkali spreading value (ASV). ASV is a
standard assay that classifies the cooking quality. Gelatinization temperature was assessed by
soaking the grains in a potassium hydroxide solution for 23 hours.

Table 6 shows the gelatinization temperatures for the pure samples. Based on the results,
the three rice types require a lower temperature to be cooked compared to Camotes com.
Mabango 3 obtained the lowest gelatinization temperature followed by Tubigan 18, Lian, and
Camotes. ASV is inversely related to the temperature at which rice starch starts to gel, meaning,
the higher the rating, the lower the gelatinization temperature (Mutters and Thompson, 2009).
Moreover, studies suggest that gelatinization temperature, which is directly related to cooking
time, has a positive correlation with amylose content (Juliano, 1985; Frederiksson et al., 1998).
Therefore, the higher the amylose content, the higher gelatinization temperature. This means that
Mabango 3 requires a shorter time to be cooked compared to Tubigan 18, Lian, and Camotes as

observed in Table 8.

Cooking Parameters

Table 7 suggests that there was a significant difference between rice type and mixture.
Results imply that Lian-Camotes mixtures required the greatest amounts of cooking water
followed by Tubigan 18-Camotes, and Mabango 3-Camotes mixtures. It was also observed that
cooking water is directly proportional to the amount of com regardless of rice type. This may be
atiributed to their amylose contents from Table 13 wherein Camotes had the highest amylose
followed by Lian, Tubigan 18, and Mabango 3. Therefore, as amount of com increases, cooking

water increases.

The analysis in Table 8 reveals that there was a significant difference between rice type
and mixture. Lian-Camotes mixtures had the longest cooking time followed by Tubigan 18-
Camotes and Mabango 3-Camotes mixtures. This agrees with the results in Table 6 wherein
Camotes had the highest temperature requirement to be gelatinized, followed by Lian, Tubigan
18, and Mabango 3. Thus, as the amylose content and amount of corn increase, cooking time

increases.

*Means sharing the same letter within columns and rows are not significantly ditferent using
Tukey’s HSD at p (<0.05).

In terms of height increase, results in Table 9 reveal that there was a significant
difference between rice type and mixture. There was also a positive relationship between the
amount of corm and height increase. Lian-Camotes mixtures, in general, obtained the greatest
height measurements followed by Tubigan 18-Camotes and Mabango 3-Camotes mixtures.

Low glycemic index varieties usually contain greater proportions of amylopectin that
absorb less amounts of water (Frei and Becker, 2003; Oko ef a/, 2014). Similarly, results from
Table 13 show that Mabango 3-Camotes mixtures contain the highest amounts of amylopectin.
Thus, the higher the amylopectin content, the lesser the height of the samples after cooking. This
may also be attributed to the results in Table 7 required for each mixture wherein Lian-Camotes

mixtures required greater amounts of cooking water compared to the other mixtures. Therefore,

as the amount of com and amylose increase, the greater the height of the samples after cooking.

Water absorption represents the ability of a sample to associate with water under a
limited water condition (Ali et a/., 2014). Water solubility, on the other hand, is the measure of
the degree of starch conversion during extrusion (Ding ef al., 2005). Results in Table 10 reveal
that there was a significant difference between rice type and mixture. Lian-Camotes mixtures had
the highest WAI and WSI. It was also observed that water absorption and solubility increased
with the increasing amount of corn regardless of rice type. Similarly, a study by Ali et al. (2014)
showed a higher absorption and solubility of PS-43 and Shalimar maize flours than Jhelum and
Kohsar rice flours. Results may also be attributed to height increase in Table 9. Mabango 3-
Camotes mixtures obtained the least water absorption indices due to high amylopectin contents

that absorb less water unlike amylose (Frei and Becker, 2003; Oko et al, 2014).

Associations Between Gel Consistency and Cooking Parameters

Table 11 summarizes the associations between gel consistency and cooking parameters.
Results suggest that gel consistency has a strong negative correlation with cooking water,
cooking time, and height increase. This means that mixtures with harder gel consistency require
greater amounts of cooking water and longer cooking time. These then result to greater height
increase of mixtures after cooking. Moreover, gel consistency has a moderate negative
correlation with WSI. Thus, a harder gel consistency appears to be more soluble it water due to
higher amylose portions that enable greater water absorption.

‘Cooking water has a strong positive correlation with cooking time and height increase
and a moderate positive correlation with WSI. This means that mixtures with greater amounts of
cooking water tend to be cooked longer. In addition, results imply that with greater amount of
cooking water, the more soluble the mixture becomes.

Cooking time has a strong positive correlation with height increase and WSI. The results
suggest that the mixtures that were cooked longer tend to increase in terms of height upon
cooking. A ionger cooking time also enables mixtures to be more in contact with water, thus
increasing the WSI.

Height increase has a moderate positive correlation with WSI. Based on the results, the
mixtures with greater percentage increase in height tend to have greater WSI. This may be
attributed to gel consistency wherein the harder the gel consistency, the greater the height
increase upon cooking, enabling mixtures to be more in contact with water as a result of greater

cooking water and longer cooking time, thus increasing the WSI.


WAL has weak negative correlation with WSI. Based on the results, Tubigan 18-Camotes
mixtures obtained the highest mean values for WAI. Contrastingly, its mixtures had the least
mean values for WSI. Results reveal that the higher the amylose content, the greater the water

absorption, thus, lowering the degree of starch conversion upon cooking.

Sensory Evaluation

Pilot Sensory Evaluation

Consumers generally choose superior qualities of rice. By sensory evaluation, preferred
quality characteristics of rice that are of economic significance could indicate important criteria
for marketability (Juliano, 1993). Thirty-one (31) proportions from the Lian-Camotes, Tubigan
18- Camotes, and Mabango 3-Camotes mixtures were subjected to sensory evaluation among 67
mothers. Sensory characteristics of the rice and pigmented com grits mix were evaluated based
on the. color, aroma, cohesiveness, taste, tenderness, and general acceptability. Out of the 31
proportions, nine were the top most acceptable namely 90:10, 80:20, and 70:30 for Lian-
Camotes, Tubigan 18-Camotes, and Mabango 3-Camotes as seen in Table 12. These samples

were subjected to chemical analyses.

Second Sensory Evaluation

Color

Color is one of the physical properties that determine grain quality (Juliano, 1993). The
90:10 Mabango 3-Camotes mix obtained the highest mean value of 6.68 (like slightly), which
was also significantly higher than other samples. On the other hand, 70:30 Tubigan 18-Camotes
had the least mean value of 5.78 (neither like nor dislike). The sensory evaluation for color
implies that as the degree of whiteness decreases or the amount of com increases, the lower the
mean value regardless of rice type as seen in Table 13. The results agree with the pilot sensory
evaluation wherein pure Camotes com obtained the lowest rating of 4.27 (dislike slightly) among

the 31 samples.

Aroma

Upon cooking, volatiles such as ammonia, hydrogen sulphide, and acetaldehyde are
emitted by rice, with 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline as the major volatile compound in aromatic rice types
(Obata and Tanaka, 1965; Buttery ef al., 1983). Aromatic rice varieties such as NSIC Re 218
(Mabango 3) are popular among market studies since these are usually more expensive than non-
aromatic rice varieties (Calingacion ef al., 2014). Sensory evaluation results in Table 13 show
that 90:10 Mabango 3-Camotes mix obtained the highest mean value of 6.89 in terms of aroma

(like slightly). In contrast, 70:36 Lian-Camotes mix had the least mean value of 5.19 (neither like


nor dislike). In summary, 90:10 Mabango 3-Camotes mix was significantly higher than all other
samples. This means that as the amount of com increases, the least a mixture becomes acceptable
in terms of aroma regardless of rice type. The results agree with the pilot sensory evaluation
wherein pure Camotes com obtained the lowest rating of 4.82 (dislike slightly) among the 31

samples.

Cohesiveness

Cohesiveness or the degree to which the sample holds together is an important
descriptive sensory attribute for cooked rice (Meilgaard et al., 1999). Results in Table 13 reveal
that 90:10 Mabango 3-Camotes obtained the highest mean value of 6.70 (like slightly), which
was also significantly higher among other samples. On the other hand, 70:30 Lian-Camotes had
the least mean value of 5.09 (neither like nor dislike). Since the amount of water used was just
enough to cook each sample, some obtained low ratings. By further increasing the amount of
water intensifies its cohesiveness (Bett-Garber et al., 2007). Therefore, the greater the amount of
com incorporated in a mixture, the lower the rating in terms of cohesiveness regardless of rice
type. The results agree with the pilot sensory evaluation wherein pure Camotes com obtained the

lowest rating of 4.51 (dislike slightly) among the 31 samples.


Tenderness

Tendemess is usually determined by hardness or the force required to compress a sample.
It is one of the imporfant sensory texture attributes of cooked rice that can determine its overall
quality and palatability most especially in Asian markets (Okabe, 1979; Meullenet ef al., 1998).
Among the samples, 90:10 Mabango 3-Camotes obtained the highest mean value of 6.41 (like
slightly), which was also significantly higher than other samples. Contrastingly, 70:30 Tubigan
“18-Camotes had the least mean value of 4.78 (dislike slightly). Tenderness may be affected by
factors such as rice variety, amylose content, and gelatinization temperature (Juliano and Perez,
1983; Del Mundo ef a/., 1989). Similarly, results in Table 13 show that as the amount of com
increases, the lower the mean value regardless of rice type. The results agree with the pilot
sensory evaluation wherein pure Camotes com obtained the lowest rating of 4.27 (dislike
slightly) among the 31 samples. This may also be attributed to the amylose content of the rice
mixtures wherein Mabango 3-Camotes mixtures appeared to have the highest ratings. Results
imply that since it is a low amylose rice type its mixtures obtained higher ratings compared to

mixtures of other rice types.
Flavor
Results in Table 13 show that 90:10 Mabango 3-Camotes had the highest mean value of

6.85 (like slightly) that was also significantly higher compared to other samples. Inversely, 70:30

Tubigan 18-Camotes obtained the lowest mean value of 5.07 (neither like nor dislike) in terms of


flavor. Therefore, the result of the sensory evaluation regardless of rice type implies that as the
amount of com increases, the least acceptable it becomes in terms of flavor. This may be due to
the preference of the participants of less corn-like flavor as evidenced by the results of the pilot

sensory evaluation wherein pure Camotes com obtained the lowest rating of 4.18 (dislike

slightly) among the 31 samples.

General Acceptability

Eating quality is the primary consideration of Filipinos in choosing rice (Muitters and
Thompson, 2009). In general 90:10, 80:20, and 70:30 Mabango 3-Camotes mixtures were the top
three most acceptable samples with mean values of 6.83, 6.66, and 6.40 (like slightly),
respectively. These samples also obtained the highest sensory characteristics among all other
samples. The values for general acceptability in Table 13 were significantly different from each
other depending on the rice type as well as the amount of com. It can also be observed that as the
amount of com increases, the acceptability rating decreases regardless of rice type. The results
agree with the pilot sensory evaluation wherein pure Camotes com obtained the lowest rating of

4.51 (dislike slightly) among the 31 samples.

Chemical Analyses

Proximate Composition

Moisture

No significant differences were observed between rice type, mixture, and rice form in
terms of moisture content as seen in Table 14. Moisture was expressed in dry basis to disregard
the dilution effect of water as a result of cooking. The conversion of moisture content on a dry
basis to a wet basis is calculated with the formula,

Megat = 100 Mary (100 + Mary}

where wet is the moisture content on a wet basis, that is, g Hz 9/100 g total mass and Mary is

the moisture content on a dry basis in g Hy 9/100 g dry matter (Nyquist and Stroshine, NA).

Crude Fat

Results suggest that there were significant differences between rice type, mixture, and
rice form in terms of crude fat content. Out of the top nine samples, 70:30 Lian-Camotes
obtained the highest crude fat with mean values of 0.77 % and 0.76 %, respectively. These were
significantly higher than 90:10 Tubigan 18-Camotes that had the lowest crude fat content values

of 0.57 % and 0.56 %, for both raw and cooked samples, respectively.


Based on the results in Table 14, there is a di. ect proportion between the amount of com
and crude fat for both raw and cooked samples. In general, maize grits have a higher crude fat
content at 1.5 g per 100g compared to well-milled rice with only 0.5 g per 100g (FNRI-DOST,
1997). The results agree with the previous statement since the crude fat values of raw and cooked
pure Camotes com were significantly higher than pure rice. Therefore, regardless of rice type

and rice form, as the amount of com increases, the mean value of crude fat also increases.

Crude Protein

Based on the results, there were significant differences between rice type. mixture, and
rice form in terms of crude protein content. Out of the top nine samples, 70:30 Tubigan 18-
Camotes mix obtained the highest crude protein mean value of 10.36 %, for both raw and cooked
samples that were significantly higher than all the other samples. The lowest mean value among
the top nine samples for crude protein shown in Table 14 was 90:10 Mabango 3-Camotes having
9.26 % for both raw and cooked samples.

In general, maize grits have a higher crude protein content at 8.3 g per 100g compared to
well-milled rice with only 7.4 g per 100g (FNRI-DOST, 1997). Similarly, results reveal that the
crude protein values of raw and cooked pure Camotes com were significantly higher than pure
rice. Thus, regardless of rice type and rice form, as the amount of corn increases, crude protein

increases.


Crude Fiber

Results suggest that there were significant differences between rice type, mixture, and
rice form in terms of crude fiber content. Out of the top nine raw and cooked samples, 70:30
Lian-Camotes obtained the highest crude fiber with mean values of 1.26 % and 1.25 %,
respectively. These were significantly higher than 90:10 Mabango 3-Camotes that had the
lowest crude fat content values of 0.65 % and 0.66 % among the top nine samples, respectively.

Based on the results in Table 14, there is a direct proportion between the amount of com
and crude fat for both raw and cooked samples since pure Camotes com contains higher amounts
of crude fiber compared to rice. Therefcre, as the amount of com increases, the mean value of

crude fiber also increases, regardless of rice type and rice form.

Total Ash

There were significant differences between rice type, mixture, and rice form in terms of
total ash content. The 70:30 Mabango 3-Camotes mix obtained the highest ash mean value of
0.93 %, for both raw and cooked samples among the top nine mixtures that were significantly
higher than all the other samples. The lowest mean value for ash shown in Table 14 were 0.74 %
and 0.73 % for 90:10 Lian-Camotes for both raw and cooked samples. It can be observed that as
the amount of corn increases, ash increases regardless of rice type and rice form. This is because

pure Camotes com contains higher amounts of ash than pure rice.


Carbohydrate (Nitrogen Free Extract)

There were significant differences between rice type, mixture, and rice form in terms of
carbohydrate content. The 90:10 Lian-Camotes mix obtained the highest carbohydrate mean
value of 88.53% and 88.54%, for both raw and cooked samples among the top nine mixtures
which were significantly higher than all the other samples. The lowest mean value for
carbohydrate among the top nine mixtures was 87.19% and 87.18 % for 80:20 Tubigan 18-
Camotes for both raw and cooked samples.

In general, maize grits have a lower carbohydrate content at 77.5 g per 100g compared to
well-milled rice with 80.4 g per 100g (FNRI-DOST, 1997). This was similar to results in Table
14 wherein the three rice types obtained higher carbohydrate contents compared to pure Camotes
com. Thus, it can be observed that as the amount of com increases, carbohydrate content

decreases regardless of rice type and rice form.

Carbohydrate Profile

Starch

Upon heating, starch granules are heated up 1o their gelatinization temperature wherein
water is absorbed and the crystalline structure is destroyed. Starch granules start to swell several
times more than its original size (Whistler, 1964). Thus, increase in starch for all samples were

evident after steaming.

Results reveal that there were significant differences between rice type, mixture, and rice
form in terms of starch content. Upon steaming, 90:10 Lian-Camotes had the highest starch
content of 86.30 % among the top nine mixtures. Consequently. 70:30 Tubigan 18-Camotes
obtained the lowest starch content of 80.55 % among the top nine cooked samples. This may be
attributed to the starch content of Camotes com that is lower than pure rice as seen in Table 15.
In summary, as the amount of com increases, starch content decreases regardless of rice type and

rice form

Amylose and Amylopectin

Based on the results, there were significant differences between rice type, mixture, and
rice form in terms of amylose content. After steaming. all samples generally increased in
amylose content. The cooked 90:10 Lian-Camotes mix obtained the highest mean value of 34.71

%, which was also significantly higher than all the other samples among the top nine mixtures.


Inversely, cooked 70:30 Mabango 3-Camotes mix had the lowest mean value of 20.74 % that
was also significantly lower compared to the other samples among the top nine mixtures. Table
15 shows that as the amount of com increases, amylose content increases regardless of rice type
and rice form. This may be due to the higher amylose content of Camotes corn than pure rice.

Results show that there were significant differences between rice type, mixture, and rice
form in terms of amylopectin content. There was a significant decrease in the amount of
amylopectin of the top nine mixtures after steaming as seen in Table 15. The 70:30 Mabango 3-
Camotes mix had the highest mean amylopectin content of 59.87 % that was also significantly
higher than the other samples among the top nine mixtures. On the other hand, 70:30 Lian-
Camotes obtained the lowest mean amylopectin content of 49.80 %, which was significantly
different than the other samples among the top nine mixtures. Therefore, as the amount of com
increases, amylopectin content decreases regardless of rice type and rice form. This may be
attributed to the higher amylopectin content of pure rice than Camotes com.

In summary, rice grains absorb water and swell when cooked at the optimum water level.
Cooking causes change in structure of components such as amylose and amylopectin due to
leaching. The amount of leached amylose and amylopectin contributes to the tendemess of rice.
Thus, as the amount of leached amylose increases, leached amylopectin decreases (Wada et al.,

2010; Patindol et al., 2010; Hanashiro et al., 2004).

calcium. Calcium levels decreased after cooking, which may be due to losses of up to 25 %

during washing and cooking in rice (Juliano, 1993). Among the top nine cooked samples, 90:10


Lian-Camotes obtained the highest mean value of 15.73 mg and 70:30 Mabango 3-Camotes with
the lowest mean value of 8.33 mg. An indirect proportion between the amount of corn and mean
caicium content was observed. This may be due to the higher calcium content of pure rice than
Camotes com as seen in Table 16. Thus, as the amount of com increases, the mean values of

calcium decreases regardless of rice type and rice form.

Iron

There were significant differences between rice type, mixture, and rice form in terms of
iron content. Results on Table 16 suggest that iron significantly decreased upon cooking. Iron
may have leached in water during washing by up to 18 to 47 % in milled rice and 23 % during
cooking (Juliano, 1993). Out of the top nine cooked samples, 90:10 Tubigan 18-Camotes
obtained the highest mean value of 0.88 mg while 70:30 Mabango 3-Camotes cooked mix had
the lowest mean value of 0.64 mg. The data implies that as the amount of com increases, iron
content decreases regardless of rice type and rice form. This may be attributed to the higher

amounts of calcium of pure rice than pure Camotes com

Zine

There were significant differences between rice type, mixture, and rice form in terms of

zinc content. In general. zinc content decreased after cooking for all the samples as observed in

Table 16. Zinc may have been lost during washing of rice by up to 11 percent and an additional


one percent during cooking (Juliano, 1993). Out of the top nine cooked mixtures, 90:10 Lian-
Camtes obtained the highest mean value at 0.74 mg. Conversely, 70:30 Mabango 3-Camotes had
the lowest mean value at 0.53 mg. Moreover, data suggest that as the amount of com increases,
mean zinc values decrease regardless of rice type and rice form. This may be due to the higher

amounts of zinc in pure rice than pure Camotes com

Phosphorus

Data analysis revealed that there were significant differences between rice type. mixture,
and rice form in terms of phosphorus content. The phosphorus content of all samples
significantly decreased upon cooking. This may be due to the losses during washing by up to 47
percent and an additional five percent during cooking in rice (Juliano, 1993). Of top nine cooked
mixtures, 90:10 Tubigan 18-Camotes obtained the highest mean value at 114.12 mg, while 70:30
Mabango 3-Camotes had the lowest mean value al 86.72 mg. Data from Table 16 also imply that
as the amount of corn increases, phosphorus content decreases regardless of rice type and rice
form. This may be due to the higher amounts of phosphorus in pure rice compared to pure

Camotes com.

Essential Amino Acids

Lysine

Based on the data analysis, there were significant differences between rice type, mixture,
and rice form in terms of lysine content. There was a significant decrease in the lysine content of
all samples upon cooking. Of the top nine cooked samples, 70:30 Lian-Camotes mix obtained the
highest mean value at 346.98 mg. On the other hand, 90:10 Tubigan 18-Camotes cooked mix had
the lowest mean value at 305.92 mg. According to literature, lysine levels are higher in brown
rice (3.8 g/16 g N) than maize (2.5 9/16 g N) (Juliano, 1993). This agrees with the results
wherein pure Camotes com obtained higher lysine levels than pure rice. Thus, data from Table
17 show that as the amount of com increases, lysine content also increases regardless of rice type

and rice form.

Tryptophan

Tryptophan levels for all samples significantly decreased after steaming. Data analysis
shows. that there were significant differences between rice type, mixture, and rice form in terms
of tryptophan content. Of the top nine cooked mixtures, 70:30 Tubigan 18-Camotes had the
highest mean value at 27.25 mg, while 90:10 Mabango 3-Camotes obtained the lowest mean
value at 19.85 mg. There was also a direct proportion between the amount of com and

tryptophan value as seen in Table 17. Thus, as the amount of com increases, tryptophan values


increase regardless of rice type and rice form. This may be attributed to the higher tryptophan

content cf pure Camotes com than pure rice.

Phytochemicals

Anthocyanidins

Table 18 shows that there was a significant decrease in anthocyanidin content among
samples after cooking. The significant iosses may be attributed to the effect of temperature,
which causes disruption of anthocyanins. Anthocyanins are anthocyanidins coupled to sugars
that are water-soluble. Anthocyanins are susceptible to high temperatures, which may destroy the
flavylium ion, and thus causes loss of color (Wageningen University, 2014).

Data analysis shows that there were significant differences between rice type, mixture,
and ;ice form in terms of anthocyanidin content. Of the top nine cooked samples, 70:30
Mabango 3-Camotes obtained the highest mean value at 16.30 mg, while 90:10 Lian-Camotes
had the lowest mean value at 14.11 mg. Data suggests that there is a direct relationship between
the amount of cor and anthocyanidin content. This may be attributed to the low levels of
anthocyanidin in pure rice. Therefore, as the amount of com increases, anthocyanidin content

increases regardless of rice type and rice form.

Flavonoids

Flavonoid content of all the samples decreased significantly after steaming. These losses

may have been due to the susceptibility of flavonoids to hydrolysis as a result of cooking

(Rommel and Wrolstad, 1993; Wrolstad, 2000). Data analysis shows that there were significant


differences between rice type, mixture, and rice form in terms of flavonoid content. Out of the
top nine cooked samples, 70:30 Mabango 3-Camotes had the highest mean value of 7.36 mg,
while 90:10 Tubigan 18-Camotes obtained the lowest mean value of 6.64 mg. Based on Table
18, as the amount of com increases, the flavonoid content increases regardless of rice type and

rice form. This may be due to the low levels of flavonoids in pure rice.

Total Phenels

Significant decrease in the mean total phenol values was observed after cooking based on
Table 18. This may be attributed to the loss of total phenolics through leaching by up to 49%
during boiling (Bunea ef a/., 2008). Of all the top nine cooked samples, 70:30 Mabango 3-
Camotes obtained the highest mean value at 10.80 mg, while 90:10 Lian-Camotes had the lowest
mean value at 9.28 mg. Data analysis shows that there were significant differences between rice
type, mixture, and rice form in terms of phenolic content. Results imply that the phenolic activity
increases as the amount of com increases regardless of rice type and rice form. This may be

attributed to the low levels of phenols in pure rice.

Beta-carotene

Significant decrease in beta-carotene mean values was observed in all the samples after
cooking. This may be due to the lixiviation phenomenon that results the loss of total carotenoids

by up to 64 % (Bunea ef a/., 2008). This may also be due to the softening of the cell wall


allowing the release of carotenoids (Rodriguez-Amaya, 1999). Based on Table 18, 70:30
Tubigan 18-Camotes obtained the highest mean value at 16.96 ug, while 90:10 Lian-Camotes
had the lowest mean value at 8.53 ug among cooked samples. Data analysis suggests that there
were significant differences between rice type, mixture, and rice form in terms of beta-carotene
content. Pure rice types obtained low levels of beta-carotene compared to pure Camotes corm.
Thus, there was a direct relationship between the amount of com and beta-carotene content,
wherein as amount of com increases, beta-carotene ~ontent also increases regardless of rice type

and rice form.

Antioxidant Capacity

There was a significant decrease in the mean values of all the samples after cooking. Of
the top nine cooked samples, 70:30 Tubigan 18-Camotes had the highest mean value of 31.19 %,
while 90:10 Lian-Camotes obtained the lowest mean value of 11.01 %. The results agree with
the study of Jimenez-Monreal e¢ al. (2009) wherein maize, upon boiling lost about 23.1 % of
lipoperoxyl scavenging activity and 8.3 % of hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. This may also
be attributed to the decrease in phytochemicals due to cooking as mentioned in the previous
discussions.

Data analysis shows that there were significant differences between rice type, mixture,
and rice form in terms of scavenging activity. Pure Camotes com obtained significantly higher
mean values than the pure rice types. Based on Table 19, as the amount of com increases,

anticxidant capacity increases regardless of rice type and rice form.

Associations Between Phytochemicals and Antioxidant Activity

Tables 20 and 21 show the associations between phytochemicals and antioxidant capacity
in raw and cooked rice and pigmented com grits mixtures, respectively. Results reveal that
anthocyanidins have a strong positive correlation with flavonoids, total phenols, and antioxidant
activity. On the other hand, flavonoids were found to have a strong positive correlation with total

phenols, beta-carotene, and antioxidant capacity. Moreover, total phenols have a strong positive


correlation with antioxidant capacity and beta-carotene. Consequently, beta-carotene has a strong
positive correlation with AOC.

This is because phenolics are phytochemicals that are responsible for plant pigments such
as beta-carotene, flavonoids, and anthocyanins. Thus, an increase in total phenols would mean an
increase in anthocyanidins that is a sub-group of flavonoids. Since all the previously mentioned
parameters that are known as phytochemicals increase, the antioxidant capacity increases

regardless of rice type and rice form.

Glycemic Index

The rate of starch digestion and absorption determine metabolic responses to meals.

Factors that influence the kinetics of starch digestion include the nature of starch, physical form,

protein and lipid interactions, presence of antinutrients and enzyme inhibitors, as well as food

processing (O’Dea et al., 1980; Wursh, 1989). Glycemic index has been used as a guide for the

diets of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. It is determined based on the relative increase in

plasma glucose within three hours after ingestion of carbohydrate, with white bread or glucose as

100 (Juliano, 1993).

The starch hydrolysis curves follow the first order equation: C= Coo (1-e“); where C is

the concentration at t time, C oo is the equilibrium concentration, k is the kinetic constant and t is


the chosen time. Figures 6 and 7 show the rate of starch hydrolysis in raw and cooked mixtures,
respectively. Starch hydrolysis between pure samples varied widely regardless of rice form. The
curves show a first part from 0 to 90 minutes where the hydrolysis rate increases and a second
from 90 to 180 minutes where a maximal plateau level is slowly reached (Gofii ef al., 1997).

All raw and cooked samples exhibited a plateau at approximately after 150 minutes of
hydrolysis. In-vitro analyses for both rice forms showed that Mabango 3 had the highest starch
digestibility among samples tested with white bread as the standard reference. This was followed

by Tubigan 18, Lian, and Camotes for both rice forms.

Figure 6. Rate of starch hydrolysis in raw samples.


Figure 7. Rate of starch hydrolysis in cooked samples.

The results of the in vitro starch digestion are summarized in Table 22, including the
estimated parameters, Coc and K in the starch hydrolysis model, the hydrolysis index (HI) and
the estimated glycemic index (EGI). Differences in terms of starch digestibility and glycemic
response between samples were observed. Significant differences were observed between rice
type. mixture, and rice form. Based on the results, total starch hydrolyzed at 90 minutes
significantly decreased after cooking.

The total starch values for the top nine raw mixtures were significantly different from
each other wherein values ranged between 43.39 % (70:30 Lian-Camotes) and 65.60 % (90:10
Mabango 3-Camotes) on a dry basis. On the other hand, the total starch values for the top nine
cooked mixtures were significantly different from each other wherein values ranged between

39.86 % (70:30 Lian-Camotes) and 58.59 % (90:10 Mabango 3-Camotes) on a dry basis. Lian-


Camotes mixtures that also have the highest amylose contents obtained the least hydrolyzed total
starch for both rice forms. Regardless of rice type and rice form, it can be observed that as the
amount of corn increases, the total hydrolyzed starch decreases (Frei ef a/., 2003).

The equilibrium constant or the hydrolysis extent when the hydrolysis curve reached a
plateau in the top nine mixtures, ranged from 49.32 % (70:30 Tubigan 18-Camotes) to 69.39%
(90:10 Mabango 3-Camotes) in raw mixtures and from 43.22 % (70:30 Lian-Camotes) to 62.17
% (90:10 Mabango 3-Camotes) in the cooked mixtures. The kinetic constants (x) that reflected
the rate of hydrolysis were significantly higher in Mabango 3-Camotes mixtures. The differences
in k values may be attributed to the rate of enzyme attack by the different degrees of swelling
(Chung er a., 2008). Thus, hydrolysis index was also highest in Mabango 3-Camotes mixtures
among the samples.

Table 22 also shows the GI classification of cooked rice and pigmented com grits
mixtures. The EGI of the top nine raw mixtures ranged between 71.37 (70:30 Lian-Camotes) and
87.26 (90:10 Mabango 3-Camotes). On the other hand, the EGI of cooked samples ranged
between 68.80 (70:50 Mabango 3-Camotes) and 82.11 (90:10 Mabango 3-Camotes). Thus,
comparing the rice types, results imply that the higher the amylose content, the lower the EGI.
Other factors such as high gelatinization temperature, long minimum cooking time, and low
volume expansion upon cooking may be able to predict low GI responses (Panlasigui ef al.,
1991). In addition, lower GI may have been caused by incomplete gelatinization of amylose
starches under normal cooking conditions.

In theory, glycemic index increases upon cooking. However, results reveal that there

were significant variations between the EGI of raw and cooked mixtures. The EGI of pure


Camotes com and 70:30 mixtures for Lian-Camotes and Tubigan 18-Camotes decreased after
cooking. This may be attributed to retrodegradation. This occurs when the gelatinized starch,
upon cooling, realigns its amylose and amylopectin portions that can either negatively or
positively affect the former molecular structure. Results were evident in Lian-Camotes and
Tubigan 18-Camotes mixtures, classified as high and intermediate amylose rice types,
respectively. This is because retrogradation of the amylopectin component is a long-term
phenomena occurring gradually unlike amylose, which re-associates more quickly. Although the

phenomenon did not completely reverse gelatinization, it can therefore contribute to the decrease

in glycemic index (FAO, 1998; Montignac, NA).

Associations Between Carbohydrate Profile and EGI

Table 23 summarizes the associations between carbohydrate profile and EGI in rice and

pigmented corn grits mixtures. Results reveal that starch has a strong positive correlation with

amylose and a moderate negative correlation with amylopectin. Results imply that the high

starch content of the mixtures depicted high amylose content and low amylopectin content.

Amylose has a strong negative correlation with amylopectin and EGI. This means that

with an increase in amylose, amylopectin portions decrease, thus lowering the EGI. On the other

hand, amylopectin has a strong positive correlation with EGI. Therefore, the higher amylopectin,

the higher the EGI, regardless of rice type in raw samples.

pigmented com grits mixtures.

Table 24 summarizes the associations between carbohydrate profile and EGI for cooked
rice and pigmented com grits mixtures. Results reveal that starch has a strong positive
correlation with amylose. This means that there were high amylose portions for the mixtures
with high starch contents in cooked mixtures.

Amylose has a strong negative correlation with amylopectin and a moderate negative
correlation with EGI. Thus, higher amylose portions of starch meant lower portions of
amylopectin. Contrastingly, amylopectin has a strong positive correlation with EGI. Therefore,

the higher amylopectin, the higher the EGI, regardless of rice type in cooked samples.

Nutritional and Health Value

The nutrient contribution of the cooked pure samples and top nine rice and pigmented
com grits mix particularly, protein, vitamin A, calcium, iron, zinc, and phosphorus were
computed based on the Estimated Average Requirements (EAR) according to the Philippine
Dietary Reference Intakes 2015 (Appendix O). EAR refers to the daily nutrient intake level that
meets the median or average requirement of healthy individuals in a particular life stage and sex
group, corrected for incomplete utilization or dietary nutrient bioavailability.

Protein is a macronutrient needed by the body to build and repair body tissues. A food
item is a source of protein if it is >10 % of Nutrient Reference Values per 100 grams. In addition,
a food is a high protein source if its protein content is >20 % of Nutrient Reference Values per
100 grarns (FAO/WHO CAC, 2007). Among the three rice types, Lian had the highest protein
content for individuals age zero to 12 years, followed by Tubigan 18 and Mabango 3. Camotes
corn, on the other hand, is a good source of protein for all age groups. Protein was evident as a
good source in all age groups of both sexes. Of the top nine cooked rice and pigmented com grits
mix, 70:30 B mix obtained the highest while 90:10 C had the lowest protein contribution. Data
from Tables 25 to 37 suggest that there is a direct relationship between the amount of com and
nutrient contribution. It can be observed that rice, upon mixing with pigmented com increased in
protein content, regardless of rice type. Therefore, the top nine rice and pigmented com grits
mixtures can be considered as good sources of proteins to potentially alleviate protein energy

malnutrition.


The dietary protein is the minimum intake that satisfies human metabolic demands to
maintain appropriate body composition and growth. To effectively satisfy metabolic demands,
protein must contain digestible amounts of essential amino acids (FAO/WHO CAC, 2007). In
this study, lysine and tryptophan are given emphasis since they cannot be synthesized by the
hurnans and are needed to support body growth and maintenance. The essential amino acid
contribution was based on the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) of lysine and tryptophan
according to FAO/WHO/UNU (2002) (APPENDIX P). DRIs are reference values that are
quantitative estimates of nutrient intakes to be used for planning and assessing diets for healthy
people (Institute of Medicine [US] Food and Nutrition Board, 1998). A food is a good source of
a essential amino acids if it contains >10 % of Nutrient Reference Values per mg/g/PRO and a
high source if has >20 % of Nutrient Reference Values per mg/g/PRO (FAO/WHO CAC, 2007).
Based on Tables 38 to 40, Lian-Camotes mixtures have the highest amounts of lysine and
tryptophan among the top nine rice and pigmented com grits mixtures. It can also be observed
that mixing rice with pigmented com increases the lysine and tryptophan contents, regardless of
Tice type. This is because Camotes com has the highest amounts for both lysine and tryptophan
compared to the other samples. Thus, rice and pigmented com grits mix can be a potential
dietary source for lysine and tryptophan, which may somehow reduce the risk of being stunted.

A food is a good source of a particular mineral if it contains >15 % of Nutrient Reference
Values per 100 grams and a high source if has >30 % of Nutrient Reference Values per 100
grams (FAO/WHO CAC, 2007). Based on the computed nutrient contribution, the top nine rice
and pigmented com grits mixtures contains low amounts of calcium and iron based on their

computed nutrient contribution in Tables 25 to 37. Only pure Lian rice was considered an iron


source in both sexes age zero to nine years. Calcium is an essential nutrient needed for muscular
contraction, mitosis, blood coagulation, nervous or synaptic impulse transmission, and structural
support of the skeleton. Calcium needs increase during childhood and adolescence since these
are rapid periods of growth and development. Similarly, calcium requirements also increase
during adulthood due to the weakening of bones and teeth as a result of aging (Pereira ef al.,
2009). Iron, on the other hand, is an important mineral since it plays a major role in oxygen
transport, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis, and electron transport (Abbaspour ef ai.,
2014). Thus, other food sources that are rich in calcium and iron must be consumed with rice and
pigmented com grits mix to meet the daily requirements.

Zinc contribution was highest in 90:10 A and lowest in 70:30 Mabango 3-Camotes based
on Tables 25 to 37. On the other hand, phosphorus contribution was highest in 90:10 Tubigan
18-Camotes and lowest in 70:30 Mabango 3-Camotes. Generally, all nine rice and pigmented
com grits mix samples were not high zinc sources for males. This is because adolescent males
have greater zinc requirements due to their higher growth rate and proportion of muscle per
kilogram body weight than females as muscles contain higher zinc than fat (Gibson, 1994).
Similarly, zinc deficiency in Japan is more evident in males due to ageing (Kogirima et al.,
2.007). In addition, Filipino males are more vulnerable to zinc deficiency than females (Marcos et
al., 2015). Thus, rice and pigmented com grits mix can be a potential source of zinc for most age
groups. Consumption of other zinc sources may be considered along with rice and pigmented
com grits mix to meet the daily requirements.

Phosphorus contribution was highest in 90:10 Tubiga 18-Camotes and lowest in 70:30

Mabango 3-Camotes. All samples were sources of phosphorus across all age groups except for


adolescents of both sexes. This is because phosphorus is needed during the rapid growth period
of adolescence to meet cellular and bone formation requirements (Institute of Medicine [US]
Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes, 1997). Based on
the results, it can be implied that rice and pigmented corn grits mix can be a potential source of
phosphorus for most age groups. Thus, consumption of other phosphorus sources may be
considered along with rice and pigmented com grits mix to meet the daily requirements.

Food sources are considered to have high antioxidant capacity if they have the ability to
scavenge free radicals and reactive oxygen species. Phytochemicals such as phenolic compounds
and carotenoids are beneficial to health due to their antioxidative activity. They are responsible
for plant pigments, taste, and flavor. One of the major classes of phenols is flavonoid (Ozcan et
al., 2014). Flavonoids are plant pigments that are synthesized from phenylalanine that are
important for human health due their role as scavengers (Yao et al., 2004). One of the main sub-
groups of flavonoids that are of particular interest in this study are anthocyanidins.
Anthocyanidins, particularly anthocyanins belong to the largest and most important group of
water-soluble natural pigments (Takeoka and Dao, 2002). They are pigments that range from red
to blue. They are potent in-vitro antioxidants that are known to improve eye vision and prevent
cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and diabetes. In addition, anthocyanins are known to have anti-
inflammatory effects, anticarcinogenic properties, and anti-microbial activity. According to
studies, no adverse health effects have been reported with oral consumption of anthocyanins. In
addition, use of anthocyanins as a natural food colorant is permitted in Europe and other
countries such as Japan and US. It was noted by the Joint FAO/ WHO Expert Committee on

Food Additives (JECFA) that anthocyanin containing-extracts had a very low toxicity (WHO,


1982) based on previous toxicological studies. The estimated acceptable daily intake (ADI) of
anthocyanins for humans was estimated to be 2.5 mg per kg’ body weight per day. This value
was based on the study in young rats wherein the no-observed-effect-level was 225 mg per kg?
body weight (Clifford, 2000; He and Giusti, 2009). Therefore, rice and pigmented com grits mix
can serve as a functional food based on its phytochemical components.

Beta-carotene is a carotenoid and the precursor of Vitamin A. It inhibits free-radical
damage to DNA and also induces cell differentiation and apoptosis of some tumor cell types,
particularly in early stages of tumorigenesis, and enhances immune system activity by
stimulating the release of natural killer cells, lymphocytes, and monocytes. It is the yellow
substance found in natural food sources. The human body converts beta-carotene to vitamin A
(NCI, 2017). Vitamin A is an essential nutrient needed by humans in minute amounts for its role
is vision, maintenance of epithelial cellular integrity, immune function, reproduction, growth,
and development (FAO/WHO, 2002). Vitamin A nutrient contribution was computed by
converting ug beta carotene to ug RE vitamin A. Based on the computed nutrient contribution
from the EAR, the top nine rice and pigmented corn grits mixtures contains low amounts of
vitamin A based on their computed nutrient contribution in Tables 25 to 37. Thus, other food
sources that are rich in Vitamin A must be consumed with rice and pigmented com grits mix to

meet the daily requirements and avoid development of vitamin A deficiency disorders.

The total food energy was computed based on the Atwater specific factor system in white
polished rice. This method considered the heat of combustion and coefficients of digestibility of
different proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. Thus, caloric values were obtained using the
following conversion factors — 4.16 kcal/g carbohydrate, 3.82 kcal/g protein. and 8.37 kcal/g fat
(FAO-UN, 2003). Out of the top nine most acceptable mixtures shown in Table 41, 90:10 Lian-
Camotes obtained the highest carbohydrate content of 368.33 kcal followed by Mabango 3
(368.20 kcal) and Tubigan 18 (366.08 kcal). Moreover, 70:30 Tubigan 18-Camotes had the
highest protein energy contribution of 39.58 kcal followed by 70:30 Lian-Camotes (38.05 kcal)
and 70:30 Mabango 3-Camotes (37.63 kcal). Furthermore, 70:30 Lian-Camotes (6.36 kcal),
70:30 Mabango 3-Camotes (6.28 kcal), and 70:30 Tubigan 18-Camotes (5.69 kcal) mixtures had
the highest amounts of fat. Overall, pure Camotes com provides higher energy content (412.17
kcal) compared to pure Lian (410.45 kcal), Tubigan 18 (410.86 kcal), and Mabango 3 (410.23

kcal).

A food is a good source of energy if it contains >15 % of Nutrient Reference Values per
100 grams and a high source if has >30 % of Nutrient Reference Values per 100 grams
(FAO/WHO CAC, 2007). The percent energy contribution of cooked rice and pigmented com
grits mixtures in Table 42 was based on the 2002 recommended energy and nutrient intakes
(RENI) wherein the recommendations for infants were derived from total energy expenditure by
doubly labeled water method and energy deposition based on rates of protein and fat gains. On
the other hand, the recommendations for children were based on a vast number of studies on
energy expenditure, growth and activity patterns of free-living, healthy individuals. The Oxford
equation including the BMR data on tropical people served as the basis for the energy
recommendations for adults (Barba and Cabrera, 2008) (Appendix Q). The top nine rice and
pigmented corn grits mixtures contributed to more than half of the daily-recommended energy
intakes for infants. Jt can also be observed that rice and pigmented com grits mixtures
contributed the lowest in males age 13 to 18 years which may be due to higher energy
requirements as a result of increased physical activity (Troiano ef a/., 2000).

Chronic intakes of high glycemic index foods may increase the risk for the development
of diabetes mellitus as a possible result of insulin resistance or pancreatic exhaustion as a result
of increased insulin demand (Willct ef a/., 2002). Pure rice types obtained the highest glycemic
indices compared to rice and pigmented com grits mixtures. Since Lian-Camotes mixtures have
the.lowest EGI among the samples, it can be consumed as an alternative staple for pure rice.
Thus, consumption of rice and pigmented corn grits mix can be a potential source of nutrient

intervention for diabetes and obesity.

CHAPTER 5

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

Thirty-one (31) rice and pigmented com grits mixtures were evaluated for their sensory
characteristics (color, aroma, cohesiveness, tendemess, flavor), general acceptability,
physicochemical properties (gel consistency, gelatinization temperature), and cooking
parameters (cooking water, cooking time, height increase, WAI, WSI). The top nine (9) most
acceptable rice and pigmented com grits mixtures were subjected to chemical analysis including
proximate composition, carbohydrate profile (starch, amylose, amylopectin), minerals (calcium,
iron, zinc, phosphorus), essential amino acids (lysine, tryptophan), phytochemicals
(anthocyanidins, flavonoids, total phenols, beta-carotene), antioxidant capacity, and EGI. The
results of the study are as follows:

1. The gel consistency of the samples ranged from 28 to 59 mm (hard to medium). On the
other hand, the gelatinization temperature for Mabango 3 was low (<70°C) and
intermediate (70°- 74°C) for Tubigan 18, Lian, and Camotes.

2. Cooking water, cooking time, and height increase were directly proportional to the
amount of com. The WAI and WSI increased with increased amounts of com.

3. Correlational analysis between gel consistency and cooking parameters revealed that:

a. Gel consistency has a strong negative correlation with cooking water, cooking

time, and height increase; and a moderate negative correlation with WS).


b. Cooking water has a strong positive correlation with cooking time and height
increase; and a moderate positive correlation with WSI.

c. Cooking time has a strong positive correlation with height increase and WSI.

d. Height increase has a moderate positive correlation with WSI.

4. Lian-Camotes mixtures (90:10, 80:20, 70:30), Tubigan 18-Camotes mixtures (90:10,
80:20, 70:30), and Mabango 3-Camoted mixtures (90:10, 80:20, 70:30) were identified as
ihe top nine mixtures based on the pilot sensory evaluation.

5. -Proximate composition between raw and cooked samples were not significantly different
from each other.

6. Minerals, essential amino acids, phytochemicals, and antioxidant capacity significantly
decreased after cooking.

7. Correlationai analysis between phytochemicals and antioxidant capacity of raw and
cooked rice and pigmented com grits mixtures suggest that:

a. Anthocyanidins have a strong positive correlation with flavonoids, total phenols,
and antioxidant capacity.

b. Flavonoids have a strong positive correlation with total phenols, beta-carotene,
and antioxidant capacity.

c. Total phenols have a strong positive correlation with antioxidant capacity and
beta-carotene.

d. Beta-carotene has a strong positive correlation with antioxidant capacity.

8. Starch and amylose significantly increased after cooking. On the other hand, amylopectin

decreased after cooking.


9. EGI was found to be lower in mixtures that have high amylose and low amylopectin
contents
10. Correlational analysis between the carbohydrate profile and EGI in raw rice and
pigmented com grits mixtures shows that:
a. Starch has a strong positive correlation with amylose and a moderate negative
correlation with amylopectin.
b. Amylose has a strong negative correlation with amylopectin and EGI.
11. Correlational analysis between the carbohydrate profile and EGI in cooked rice and
pigmented com grits mixtures shows that:
a. Starch has a strong positive correlation with amylose.
b. Amylose has a strong negative correlation with amylopectin and a moderate
negative correlation with EGI.
12. Based on CODEX Alimentarius, EAR, and RENI, rice and pigmented com grits mix is a
good source of protein, zinc, phosphorus, and energy and thus, can contribute to food and

nutrition security.

CHAPTER 6

RECOMMENDATIONS

With all the current advancements, it is still a challenge to promote the consumption of

healthier food choices. Therefore, it is important to conduct more researches on the acceptability

of rice and pigmented com grits mix. With the spread of the valuable information from the

recommended studies, there is a great potential for consumers to adapt better food choices.

1.

Extrinsic characteristics such as raw product appearance, packaging, and labeling that
also determine product characteristics and acceptability may be considered in another
research.

Mixing pigmented com with other rice varieties such as the colored one may also be
done.

Other factors such as demography and socio-economic status may be added as variables
for further studies.

Health attributes that are not included in the study may be analyzed to establish health
claims.

Marketing and economic studies including product pricing may also be a supplementary

study to promote consumption of rice and pigmented com grits mix.
